abstract = "With the development of IoT technologies in the past few years, a wide range of smart devices are deployed in a variety of environments aiming to improve the quality of human life in a cost efficient way. Due to the increasingly serious aging problem around the world, smart homes for elder healthcare have become an important IoT-based application, which not only enables elders’ health to be properly monitored and taken care of, but also allows them to live more comfortably and independently in their houses. However, elders’ privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication. To show that elders’ privacy could be substantially exposed, in this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders’ movement activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS in deducing and disclosing elders’ privacy, which might be maliciously exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.",

abstract = "Background
Steadily increasing numbers of older people and people in need of care represent critical challenges for today’s society. In the last years, diverse (health-related) technologies have been developed to facilitate living at home for older people but also to support (professional) care personnel in their daily care efforts. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have the potential to enhance safety, support medical therapy, or facilitate everyday chores and social life. With the huge range and variety of technical opportunities, the question arises what influences (potential) users’ decisions for the right technology in their individual conditions and situations. In particular with regard to the fragility of the care situation, it is unknown which technologies are desired for different care needs and diverse situations.
Objectives
The present study investigates (1) personal care needs as a potential influencing parameter for technology acceptance and (2) the selection of specific technologies.
Method
In an online questionnaire (including n = 162 people of all ages), technology acceptance and the selection of specific technologies was assessed, using two scenarios differing in their personal care needs (low care needs vs. moderate care needs) in two situational contexts (emergency detection vs. medical reminders).
Results
Personal care needs influence the perception of benefits, barriers, and general acceptance of assisting technologies, independent from situational context. Higher needs for care lead to higher acknowledgements of the technology’s benefits, lower agreements or, in parts, higher rejections of potential barriers and higher acceptance. The two care situations differ regarding the participants’ preferences for technologies: For emergency detection, smart watches and emergency buttons are clearly accepted. In contrast, cameras are consistently rejected. For situations in which medical reminders are used, smartphone and smartwatches are most wanted, whereas audio assistants and smart TV were rather rejected.
Conclusions
The results provide insights into users’ preferences for specific technologies for the purpose of emergency detection and medical reminders as well as for the important influence of personal care needs. These insights can be used to derive user-tailored solutions of technology configurations for specific care needs and situations.",

Ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies and services might be a solution to address those challenges. Recent improved capabilities in both ambient and wearable technologies, especially those related with video and lifelogging data, and huge advances in the accuracy of intelligent systems for AAL are leading to more valuable and trustworthy services for older people and their caregivers. These advances have been particularly relevant in the last years due to the appearance of RGB-D devices and the development of deep learning systems. This article reviews these latest developments in the intersection of AAL, intelligent systems, lifelogging, and computer vision. This paper provides a study of previous reviews in these fields, and later analyses newer intelligent techniques employed with different video-based lifelogging technologies in order to offer lifelogging services for AAL. Additionally, privacy and ethical issues associated with these technologies are discussed. This review aims at facilitating the understanding of the multiple fields involved.",

abstract = "Statistics show that a bathroom is one of the most hazardous places especially for older people. Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed. Authors propose 1) sensor selection and application, 2) integration of a wireless sensor local network system, 3) design concept for IoT implementation, and 4) a big data analysis system model in this paper.",

The case study – dealing with the introduction of care robots in a care facility for the elderly – will be examined by an ethnographical qualitative analysis as well as by three theoretical approaches often used in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). We combine these three approaches with an ethnographical analysis to achieve a deeper understanding of several difficulties with pTD that are typical in the realization within the AAL field, especially when a mediating method, such as SBD, is adopted. In this respect the theoretical contribution consists of outlining the importance of a strictly bottom-up view on pTD. Finally, we conclude with two general recommendations on how the inclusion of care workers and older people as target groups of pTD within the AAL field can be accomplished more successfully.",

The need to support these elderly, in difficulty has prompted researchers to focus on the field of home care.

Hence, Quality Criteria (QCs) must be identified and well defined to successfully achieve the system purposes. The goal is to obtain a set of data quality characteristics that would be applicable to the context of AAL systems and evaluate them using data coming from multiple sensors. To do this, we based our work on ISO/IEC 25012 and ISO/IEC 25010 standards that establish QCs respectively on system and software product quality and data quality, to extract the most relevant QCs that could be more fitting for AAL systems. We have applied an approach to extract the most important criteria than can be associated with AAL system based on the acquisition, the transmission, and the treatment processes. To convince all stakeholders including both technologies and end users of AAL systems, high quality must be guaranteed, but measuring quality in AAL system is difficult because of the variety of stakeholders. To evaluate the entire data quality model for AAL system, we will apply an evaluation procedure on this model, which consists first make our model hierarchically, then evaluate it using the metrics based on the sensor data and the concept of fuzzy logic.",

Compared with other European countries, older people in Romania experience high rates of poverty and disability. In this, the first study to investigate wellbeing in older Romanian people attending public and third sector day facilities, we tested our hypotheses, based on a successful aging model, that greater wellbeing would be associated with a healthier lifestyle (lower levels of alcohol consumption and smoking), better physical health, mental health, social support (less loneliness) and absence of abuse.
Methods
Older people (65+) without significant cognitive impairment, recruited from three Bucharest social care centers, completed structured questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5).
Results
100/140 (71%) eligible potential participants approached participated; mean WHO-5 score was 67.7 (standard deviation=20.7); 25 (25%) scored <50, indicating low wellbeing. In our final model, lower depression (β=−0.40, t=−3.8, p<0.001) and loneliness scores (β=−0.22, t=−2.1, p=0.034) predicted higher wellbeing. More physical health problems and hospitalisations were associated with lower wellbeing on univariate analyses, but not in the final model. Screening positive for abuse (23 (23%) of participants), activities of daily living, alcohol and smoking status did not predict wellbeing.
Conclusions
Despite experiencing high rates of loneliness, depression, anxiety and abuse, this population of older, Romanian people receiving social support, reported wellbeing levels comparable to European working populations. Loneliness was a more important predictor of lower wellbeing than any other factors studied. Tailored interventions to reduce loneliness in Romanian older people receiving community social support would be a rational next step.",

abstract = "Falls represent a major public health risk worldwide for the elderly people. A fall not assisted in time can cause functional impairment in an elder and a significant decrease in his mobility, independence and life quality. In that sense, the present work proposes an innovative IoT-based system for detecting falls of elderly people in indoor environments, which takes advantages of low-power wireless sensor networks, smart devices, big data and cloud computing. For this purpose, a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN device wearable is used, which is responsible for collecting data from movements of elderly people in real-time. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, the sensor readings are processed and analyzed using a decision trees-based Big Data model running on a Smart IoT Gateway. If a fall is detected, an alert is activated and the system reacts automatically by sending notifications to the groups responsible for the care of the elderly people. Finally, the system provides services built on cloud. From medical perspective, there is a storage service that enables healthcare professional to access to falls data for perform further analysis. On the other hand, the system provides a service leveraging this data to create a new machine learning model each time a fall is detected. The results of experiments have shown high success rates in fall detection in terms of accuracy, precision and gain.",

The purpose of this study is to determine Sundanese family habits in caring for older people with diabetes in Tasikmalaya, West Java, Indonesia.
Method
This study using a qualitative phenomenological method, via in-depth interviews, in which the saturation point was reached at the ten participants. The ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, maleficence, and justice were applied.
Results
This study identified two main topics: first, family ability to perform family health tasks and second, the different types of family cultures that influence taking care of the health of older people, which were reflected through several sub-topics, namely, pampering the parents, doing everything they asked, and controlling all their activities. The habits of pampering and assenting to the wishes of older people with diabetes are highly risky, as, when they are food-related, they can increase blood glucose.
Conclusion
The findings of this study reveal that the family habits which highly risky to increase blood glucose older people must be changed through negotiation efforts and cultural restructuring, such that the treatments provided are in accordance with the diabetes management pattern. The results of the present study are useful in improving health services for older people with diabetes in the multicultural country of Indonesia.",

In particular, we propose an algorithm based on a heuristic and machine learning to detect ‘long-lie’ situations. The proposed algorithm minimizes the effects of noise present in the RFID information by relying on eight features extracted using only binary tag observation information from a possible location of a fall on the smart carpet. By evaluating the proposed approach with broadly scripted activities, which included a complex set of walking patterns, we show that the proposed algorithm depicts a good overall performance of 93% F-score.",

Using paired t-tests and probit models, we compared the differences in these productive activities among older people in terms of sex and living area. The results from various t-tests showed that educational attainment, health status and poverty status were key factors differentiating older men and women and rural and urban older people in these productive activities. For the probit estimations in terms of both gender and living location, the results indicated that age, education, health status and supportive children were determinants of working decision, while age, marital status and size of household were consistently important factors of taking care of (great)grandchildren.

It is well established that social exclusion is a key social determinant of health; however, such association between social exclusion and health outcomes among older people remain a relatively under-researched area. This paper explores the effects of four dimensions of social exclusion on self-rated health and depression among older people in China.
Methods
This paper includes 8038 individuals aged 60 and over from the first wave national multi-stage probability sample (2014) from the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS). Descriptive univariate information for individual variables and four dimensions of social exclusion are presented. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models are used to examine the associations between social exclusion and self-rated health and depression.
Results
Older people who were in the lower level of exclusion from social relationships or subjective feelings of exclusion were significantly less likely to report fair or poor self-rated health than people in the higher level of exclusion (lower level of exclusion from social activities was significantly associated with being less likely to report poor SRH only). Older people who were in the lower level of subjective feeling of exclusion or exclusion from financial products were significantly less likely to report depression.
Conclusions
Different dimensions of social exclusion have different effects on self-rated health and depression. Social policies need to reflect this and efforts of services could usefully be oriented to prevent multi-dimensions of social exclusion. Ultimately, such policies should have the potential to enhance the health of older people in China.",

Falls in older people is a global public health concern. Physical exercise is a useful and potentially cost-saving treatment option to prevent falls in older people.
Objectives
We aimed to (1) summarize the research literature regarding the cost-effectiveness of exercise-based programs for falls prevention in older people and (2) discuss the implications of the review's findings for clinical practice and future research on the dosage of cost-effective exercise-based falls prevention programs for older people.
Methods
Multiple databases were searched from inception until February 2019. Studies were included if they (1) were randomized controlled trials with an economic evaluation of exercise-based falls prevention programs for people ≥ 60 years old and (2) assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost per quality-adjusted life year, incremental cost per fall and benefit-to-cost ratio of programs. Methodological quality was assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and quality of economic evaluation with the Quality of Health Economic Studies.
Results
We included 12 studies (3668 older people). Interventions for falls prevention were either exercise-only or multifactorial programs. Five studies of high economic quality and 2 of high methodological quality provided evidence supporting exercise-only programs as cost-effective for preventing falls in older people. Specifically, a tailored exercise program including strengthening of lower extremities, balance training, cardiovascular exercise, stretching and functional training of moderate intensity performed twice per week with each session lasting 60min for ≥ 6 months delivered in groups of 3 to 8 participants with home-based follow-up appears to be cost-effective in preventing falls in older people.
Conclusion
There is evidence to support exercise-based interventions as cost-effective treatment for preventing falls. Further research is needed to fully establish the cost-effectiveness of such programs, especially in both developing and underdeveloped countries.

Elder abuse (abuse/violence/neglect or disrespect as defined by BKPAI data) among elderly is a deserted and overlooked issue especially in developing countries including India.
Aim
To assess the elder abuse and its association with socio-demographic factors among elderly population.
Materials and Methods
This study comprises data from BKPAI 2011. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis have been used for the following study.
Results
A total of 9852 elderly people were included in this study which was carried out in seven states of India. The mean age of the study subjects was 68.04±7.29 years. Among 9852 elderly people 10% (987) were faced elder abuse. In unadjusted odd-ratio the status of elder abuse was found statistically significant with state, type of residence, sex, age group, caste, education, marital status, migration status, occupation, health condition and economic dependency etc. But in binary logistic regression analysis state, type of residence, sex, education, caste and their migration status were found statistically significant with elder abuse.
Conclusion
From the result of this study, the existence of “violence”, “neglect”, and “disrespect” within the society and community is approved. The problems of abuse among older persons were more mental than physical and elderly at getting older, without partner, with bad health condition, having less money or with no security are on more risk of getting abused.",

This study provides a comprehensive understanding that remittances from migration relax the constraints on household resource allocations in undeveloped rural areas with imperfect market conditions. Overall, left-behind elderly parents benefit from migrant children both physically and mentally.",

abstract = "In recent years several world-wide ambient assisted living (AAL) programs have been activated in order to improve the quality of life of older people, and to strengthen the industrial base through the use of information and communication technologies. An important issue is extending the time that older people can live in their home environment, by increasing their autonomy and helping them to carry out activities of daily livings (ADLs). Research in the automatic detection of falls has received a lot of attention, with the object of enhancing safety, emergency response and independence of the elderly, at the same time comparing the social and economic costs related to fall accidents. In this work, an algorithmic framework to detect falls by using a 3D time-of-flight vision technology is presented. The proposed system presented complementary working requirements with respect to traditional worn and non-worn fall-detection devices. The vision system used a state-of-the-art 3D range camera for elderly movement measurement and detection of critical events, such as falls. The depth images provided by the active sensor allowed reliable segmentation and tracking of elderly movements, by using well-established imaging methods. Moreover, the range camera provided 3D metric information in all illumination conditions (even night vision), allowing the overcoming of some typical limitations of passive vision (shadows, camouflage, occlusions, brightness fluctuations, perspective ambiguity). A self-calibration algorithm guarantees different setup mountings of the range camera by non-technical users. A large dataset of simulated fall events and ADLs in real dwellings was collected and the proposed fall-detection system demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity.",

In this paper, we present two data-driven models (a field study model and a lab study model) using the algorithm of random forests to predict older people's thermal sensation. These two models were developed from a field study dataset and a lab study dataset separately. The field study dataset was collected from 1040 old subjects (70 + years) who lived in 19 aged-care homes, which contains multi-dimension factors such as environmental parameters, subjects' demographic information, health condition, acclimatization degrees, living habits and thermal perceptions' votes. The lab study dataset was collected from a lab study and contains 18 old subjects' (65 + years) eight local skin temperatures and thermal perceptions' votes under five thermal environments (21/23/26/29/32 °C). After the procedure of feature selection, the field study model was developed with four environmental variables (air temperature, velocity, CO2 concentration, illuminance) plus two human-related variables (health condition and living time in aged-care homes) as inputs. It produced an overall accuracy of 56.6%, which was 24.9% higher than that of the PMV model. The lab study model was built on five local skin temperatures including head, lower arm, upper leg, chest and back temperatures, which demonstrated an overall accuracy of 76.7%, 30.1% higher than UC Berkeley thermal sensation model's accuracy. We then interpreted how these inputs distinguish thermal sensations by applying a partial dependence analysis. Finally, we proposed two applications of the above models and present older people's seasonally neutral indoor temperature zones.",

In the past century, elder abuse has become an important health issue and a stressful event that negatively affects the physical and mental health of the elders.
Aims
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of elder abuse in Iran through systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
All articles about elderly abuse in Iran since 2005–2017 were searched using the Google Scholar search engine, four Iranian databases (Magiran, IranMedex, SID) and six international English language databases(Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Pubmed, Science Direct-Embase) with keywords of Elder Abuse, Elder Mistreatment, Elder Neglect, Abuse and a combination of these keywords. After examining the entry and exit criteria and qualitative evaluation of the articles, Data was analyzed by comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software.
Findings
In a systematic review, 15 articles on elders in Iran were included in the study. The overall prevalence of elder abuse was 48.3% (with 95% confidence interval: 28.6–68.6) and the highest prevalence of elder abuse was related to the care neglect dimensionat the prevalence rate of 38.4% (with 95% confidence interval: 21.7–51.6) and the lowest prevalence rate of elder abuse was related to the rejection atthe prevalence rate of 11% (with 95% confidence interval: 6.9–17.1).
Conclusion
The prevalence of elder abuse among elders was high in Iran. Considering the growing elderly population in Iran, preventive measures should be considered in this regard. For this reason, community health nurses are required to provide the elderly, family and community with necessary preventive interventions in this regard.",

During the last decades scientific literature has focused on the positive relationships between Nature - Based Activities (NBA) and health. The aging of the population and the increasing costs of health services make it important to investigate the benefits for older people.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to systematically review the existing literature regarding Nature – Based Activities addressed to older people.
Methods
A systematic search of the literature was made in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus from 2005 till December 2018.
Results
We identified 42 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The results highlighted the multidisciplinary use of nature in many settings as well as a variety of different research designs, both quantitative and qualitative. The majority of experimental assessments were carried out in the setting of nursing homes and residential facilities. A variety of treatments, e.g. horticultural therapy, gardening, green visiting, green exercise and of settings, e.g. residential facilities or adult day services, participants’ homes, outdoor settings, and green care farms were examined.
Conclusions
The examined studies offered numerous examples of the healing power of nature for the health and well-being of older people. Occupational therapists could gain substantial insight from earlier experiences of NBA for application in their practices.",

The number of Seniors Councils in Poland has grown in recent years thanks to favorable legislative changes in 2013 and 2015. Since 2015, the local executive administration is obliged to establish a Seniors Council if there is local demand for such a council. The influence of senior councils is likely to grow over the coming years, given the ageing of the population and the related increasing importance of older citizens in the electorate, especially for local political leaders. Seniors Councils can support better informed local decision-making by helping to identify local needs and contributing to a better allocation of scarce resources. They may also help to draw more resources to health promotion and primary prevention for older people in an environment of financial constraints and a health care system that traditionally prioritizes curative care.",

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for periodontitis for over 40 years and novel evidence suggests that periodontitis has an impact on glycemic control in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to compare oral health complications in diabetic older patients from Brazil and France.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 120 patients aged 65 and over diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Sixty patients were admitted to a center for diabetes and hypertension care in Brazil and 60 patients were admitted to the Rouen University hospital. Dental conditions were assessed through the decayed, missing and filled teeth index and periodontal condition was assessed using the Community Periodontal Index. The significance threshold was p < 0.05.
Results
Decayed teeth differed statistically between the groups (p = 0.001). The French group presented more tooth mobility, gingival recession and furcation involvement (p < 0.001). Tooth brushing frequency differed significantly between the groups (p < 0.030). The main cause of missing teeth was periodontitis in the French group and caries and periodontitis in the Brazilian group (p < 0.001). Statistical significance was found for use of fixed upper (p = 0.013) and lower (p = 0.013) dentures in the French group. The French group needed upper denture rehabilitation (p = 0.010) while the Brazilian group needed lower denture rehabilitation (p = 0.003).
Conclusion
Edentulism was prevalent in diabetic older people in both countries. However, the French participants presented with better oral health.",

abstract = "Although the population of older people in Africa is increasing, and older people are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to urbanisation, breakdown of family structures and rising healthcare costs, most African countries have no social health protection for older people. Two exceptions include Senegal's Plan Sesame, a user fees exemption for older people and Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) where older people are exempt from paying premiums. Evidence on whether older people are aware of and enrolling in these schemes is however lacking. We aim to fill this gap. Besides exploring economic indicators, we also investigate whether social exclusion determines enrolment of older people. This is the first study that tries to explore the social, political, economic and cultural (SPEC) dimensions of social exclusion in the context of social health protection programs for older people. Data were collected by two cross-sectional household surveys conducted in Ghana and Senegal in 2012. We develop SPEC indices and conduct logistic regressions to study the determinants of enrolment. Our results indicate that older people vulnerable to social exclusion in all SPEC dimensions are less likely to enrol in Plan Sesame and those that are vulnerable in the political dimension are less likely to enrol in NHIS. Efforts should be taken to specifically enrol older people in rural areas, ethnic minorities, women and those isolated due to a lack of social support. Consideration should also be paid to modify scheme features such as eliminating the registration fee for older people in NHIS and creating administration offices for ID cards in remote communities in Senegal.",

abstract = "Background
Polypharmacy is associated with inappropriate medication use, and subsequently increasing older persons’ risk of drug-related harm and health-related costs to individuals and society.
Objective
To examine and describe, using a national sample of patient-level medication data, the prevalence of older people's polypharmacy and medication use across dependency levels. To examine oral and general pain prevalence and associated analgesic usage.
Methods
Medication data from the 2012 New Zealand Older People's Oral Health Survey, a nationally-representative, cross-sectional study of dependent older people's oral health, were analysed descriptively, comparing classes and sub-classes of drugs and nutrient supplements taken across four categories of dependency: very low (own homes receiving in-home support), low, high and psychogeriatric (all receiving aged residential care). Self-reported current general pain and frequency of orofacial pain data were cross-tabulated by sub-classes of analgesics taken.
Results
All participants were taking at least one medication overall, 53.2% (95% CI: 50.4, 56.0) took between five and nine (polypharmacy), and 13.9% (95% CI: 17.4, 22.5) took 10 or more (hyperpolypharmacy). Antihypertensives, analgesics, antiulcer drugs, aspirin, laxatives, statins and antidepressants were the most common drug classes taken, the proportions differing between psychogeriatric level care and all other dependency groups. Overall, simple analgesics were taken (34.5%; 95%CI: 30.8, 38.4) more commonly than other analgesics; the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was low (3.6%; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.7). Of those reporting experiencing extreme general bodily pain, 63.3% (95% CI: 56.6, 69.4) took an analgesic, more than those experiencing mouth pain occasionally or often. Fat-soluble vitamins were the most common vitamin supplement taken (32.0%; 95%CI: 27.0, 37.4).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy are common among older people, regardless of dependency level, and pain may be undertreated.",

Population ageing has become a public health issue as it is associated with increased morbidity, institutionalization and death. These may directly affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of older people.
Purpose
The aim of the study was to investigate HRQOL and its associated factors among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district, Sri Lanka.
Method
This cross-sectional survey involved 1300 older people. The Euro 5D-3L, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, body mass index, handgrip strength were used to measure HRQOL, physical activity and nutritional status of older people respectively. Factors associated with health-related quality of life were identified through complex sample logistic regression analysis.
Results
Majority of older people (81.9%) reported poor health-related quality of life. Middle old (aOR: 12.06, 95% CI: 5.76, 25.23), very old (aOR: 174.74, 95% CI: 39.74, 768.38), vegetarian diets (aOR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.96), under-nutrition (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.65, 7.04) and over-nutrition (aOR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.28) were significantly associated with poor HRQOL. Using dentures (aOR: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.90) was found as a protective factor for poor HRQOL.
Conclusions
HRQOL was poor among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district. Nutrition-related factors need to be further investigated to improve HRQOL among older people.",

There were no statistical differences in estimated vector of preference parameters based on the presence or absence of cognitive impairment (Chi-squared = 13, 25 df, p = 0.976).

Elder abuse in recent times has reached a remarkable international importance. This complex phenomenon is still little understood and studied in Italy. The aim of this study was to explore Italian healthcare professionals’ attitude and barriers toward elder abuse, with a glimpse on the current scenario and evidences to develop an action plan.
Materials and methods
42 healthcare professionals filled a questionnaire with 13 open-ended questions, analyzed with a qualitative content analysis. Data were grouped under the following 4 core-themes: description of elder abuse, abuse detection and perception, barriers to reporting, and professional orientation and approach; then they were analyzed to find their central component and discussed jointly.
Results
The respondents described physical (64%) and psychological (50%) abuse and neglect (50%) as the three main characteristics of elder abuse; the 59% of them reported at least one experience in detecting or suspecting elder abuse. The 76% of participants believed the report has to be submitted to the Judicial Authority only in presence of compelling evidences. Furthermore, the 73% of the sample perceived that healthcare professionals are the main figures who have to cope with elder abuse, however they did not feel as their exclusive role the assessment of the patients’ potential abuse.
Conclusion
Knowledge about elder abuse was limited to physical/psychological issues and, moreover, the legal obligation to report was only poorly known. Imperative is the creation of specific education and training courses, in addition to the need for a multidisciplinary and empathetic approach.",

abstract = "Purpose
This paper describes proposed health care services innovations, provided by a system called CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisted Living eXperiment). CAALYX aimed to provide healthcare innovation by extending the state-of-the-art in tele-healthcare, by focusing on increasing the confidence of elderly people living autonomously, by building on the knowledge base of the most common disorders and respective characteristic vital sign changes for this age group.
Methods
A review of the state-of-the-art on health care services was carried out. Then, extensive research was conducted on the particular needs of the elderly in relation to home health services that, if offered to them, could improve their day life by giving them greater confidence and autonomy. To achieve this, we addressed issues associated with the gathering of clinical data and interpretation of these data, as well as possibilities of automatically triggering appropriate clinical measures. Considering this initial work we started the identification of initiatives, ongoing works and technologies that could be used for the development of the system. After that, the implementation of CAALYX was done.
Findings
The innovation in CAALYX system considers three main areas of contribution: (i) The Roaming Monitoring System that is used to collect information on the well-being of the elderly users; (ii) The Home Monitoring System that is aimed at helping the elders independently living at home being implemented by a device (a personal computer or a set top box) that supports the connection of sensors and video cameras that may be used for monitoring and for interaction with the elder; (iii) The Central Care Service and Monitoring System that is implemented by a Caretaker System where attention and care services are provided to elders, where actors as Caretakers, Doctors and Relatives are logically linked to elders. Innovations in each of these areas are presented here.
Conclusions
The ageing European society is placing an added burden on future generations, as the ‘elderly-to-working-age-people’ ratio is set to steadily increase in the future. Nowadays, quality of life and fitness allows for most older persons to have an active life well into their eighties. Furthermore, many older persons prefer to live in their own house and choose their own lifestyle. The CAALYX system can have a clear impact in increasing older persons’ autonomy, by ensuring that they do not need to leave their preferred environment in order to be properly monitored and taken care of.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify, critically appraise and synthesize qualitative evidence of self-care experiences in health promotion for home-dwelling elders.
Design
A meta-synthesis was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines and using Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument Software.
Data sources
The literature search was conducted on PubMed, CINHAL, Embase, PsycInfo, Eric and ILISI databases from inception up until March 2015. Other articles were searched on Scopus and Web of Knowledge. The reference list of all the identified articles was also searched for additional studies. Studies published in English, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were considered for inclusion in the review.
Review methods
Data from the selected qualitative articles were extracted independently by two reviewers using the data extraction tool of the Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. The meta-synthesis involved the following three steps: the production of a set of statements representing the aggregated data obtained by assembling the findings of qualitative studies; the categorization of findings on the basis of similarity in meaning; and the aggregation of these categories to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. No studies were excluded due to methodological quality.
Results
Of the 4001 records identified, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most articles were conducted in Scandinavian countries and used a phenomenological design. Most elders in the sample were middle-class, cognitively intact, independent, and in good health. The meta-synthesis revealed that older people living at home make decisions about their self-care activities on the basis of their attitudes toward their life and future. These self-care activities are directed toward holistic wellness, prevention and treatment of aging effects, obtaining a sense of satisfaction, and self-realization. Furthermore, self-care activities are settled in a social and relational network that allows old people to take care of themselves and of others or to be cared for by others.
Conclusions
This meta-synthesis presents the perspectives of home-dwelling old people on health-promoting self-care experiences. Such information can help healthcare professionals to maintain long-term autonomy of elders in self-care and to promote healthy aging. Further qualitative research describing self-care experiences of home-dwelling elders from different cultures, education levels, and social backgrounds is needed.",

Concerns over the cost of heating and cooling were shared among the majority of respondents and particularly among people with low incomes. Findings from this study highlight the importance of providing information to older people, carers, designers and policy makers about the interrelationships between weather, housing design, heating and cooling behaviours, thermal comfort, energy use and health and well-being, in order to support older people to age in place independently and healthily.",

abstract = "Background and purpose
There has been much discussion about the risk factors for osteoporosis, but studies involving elderly population in Taiwan are minimal. We aimed to describe variables related to osteoporosis among community dwelling older people in Taiwan.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study. The 671 participants were randomly selected from 3680 examinees of the annual Senior Citizens Health Examination in year 2010. Participants were interviewed with a detailed questionnaire, and 91 of them were invited for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Predictor variables included age, gender and clinical risk factors for osteoporosis. The main outcome was osteoporosis confirmed by DXA.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 75.7±6.4years old. Overall, the most prevalent variables for osteoporosis were height loss in adulthood (41.0%), lack of dairy products or calcium supplements (32.0%) and insufficient physical activity (10.4%). In multivariate models, we found that underweight (OR=9.80) and lack of dairy products/calcium supplements (OR=3.68) were the main variables for osteoporosis. In the subgroup analysis involving only women, underweight (OR=14.60) was the main variable.
Discussion
Among community-dwelling older people in Taiwan, osteoporosis was mainly associated with underweight and lack of dairy products or calcium supplements.
Conclusion
We suggest using the key questions of underweight and dietary pattern in clinical settings to identify high risk people who are candidates for further BMD exam.",

Results
A majority of Japanese elders (79%) agreed with unified guidance in combination with the issue of health insurance cards at age 65 or 75. The most preferred method for receiving information was video presentation.

This study aimed to explore sociodemographic characteristics and psychosocial wellbeing of elderly with chronic illnesses who live with family at home.
Methods
This is a descriptive correlational study that was conducted in Pekanbaru. This study involved 85 elders that were recruited using purposive sampling technique. Data were obtained by using questionnaires.
Results
Descriptive analysis using a computer software showed that 96.5% of elderly were Muslim, 48.2% were from Minang tribe, 55.3% were female, 56.5% were married, 78.8% were low-educated, 83.5% were unemployed, and 84.7% had experience of losing a spouse, and showed that 56.5% of elderly have high psychosocial wellbeing state, which reflected psychological health and the ability to interact socially. Of all sociodemographic characteristics of the elders, all indicated higher psychosocial wellbeing state except for single elders or don’t have a life partner and unemployed elders. Chi-square test showed no significant relationship between educational level, marital status, employment status, and bereavement experience with psychosocial wellbeing of the elders (p>0.05).
Conclusions
The majority of the elderly with chronic illnesses who live with family at home were at good psychosocial wellbeing. Measures are needed to improve psychosocial wellbeing of single elders or don’t have a life partner and unemployed elders.",

abstract = "Purpose
To explore the combined effect of trends in older people on their future healthcare utilisation.
Methods
A Delphi study consisting of two rounds was conducted. The heterogeneous expert panel (n = 16) in the field of elderly care rated the effect of combinations of trends in the Netherlands on the use of seven healthcare services: i.e. informal, home, general practitioner, acute, specialist, nursing home and mental health care. The percentage and direction of the overall consensus, for the different health services, and for three main trends were analysed.
Results
Experts reached consensus in 57 of 92 ratings (62%). Taking into account the interaction between trends, they expected an extra increase for informal, home, and general practitioner care, but no additional effect of interaction for specialist and acute care. Combinations that included trends leading to less support were expected to lead to an extra increase in utilisation.
Conclusions
Experts expect that interaction between trends will lead to an extra increase in the use of general practitioner, home, and informal care. This increase is mainly the result of interaction with trends leading to less support for older persons. The present results show the need to take the effect of interaction into account when designing new health policy and in research on future healthcare utilisation.",

Twenty community-dwelling people of advanced age (85+) were recruited in 2015–16 from a large multidisciplinary longitudinal study of advanced age. These twenty participated in interviews about health in advanced age, impact of illnesses, interactions with clinicians, access to information, support for managing health, and perceptions of primary care, medications, and other forms of assistance. We use a positioning theory framework drawing on thematic and narrative analysis to understand the dynamic ways people in advanced age position themselves and the ways they age well through speech acts and storylines. People in advanced age saw themselves as challenged, rather than threatened, by adversities, and positioned themselves as able to draw on a lifetime of experience and resourcefulness and collaborations with supporters to deal with challenges. Key strategies include downplaying illness and resisting biomedical discourses of complexity, positioning embodied selves as having agency, and creative adaptation in the face of loss. People in advanced age exhibit resilience, maintaining wellbeing, autonomy and good physical and mental quality of life even while living with challenges such as functional decline and multi-morbidities. These findings have significance for supporters of older people, emphasising the need to move away from a narrow focus on problems to working together WITH people in advanced age to offer a more holistic approach that encourages and enhances adaptation and flexibility, rather than rigid and counterproductive coping patterns.",

abstract = "Background
Although frailty of older people has been shown to be associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, evidence on healthcare costs associated with frailty is scarce.
Methods
Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and AMED were electronically searched in January 2019 based on a protocol in accordance with the PRISMA statement using Medical Subjective Heading and free text terms, with explosion functions. Language restriction was not applied. Studies were considered if they were published between 2000 to January 2019 and provided healthcare costs stratified by the frailty status categories among community-dwelling older people with a mean age of 60 years or higher. Reference lists of the included studies were reviewed for additional studies. Healthcare costs according to frailty status were compared using standardized mean difference random-effects meta-analysis.
Results
The systematic review found 3116 citations. After screening for title, abstract, and full-text for eligibility, 5 studies involving 3742362 participants were included. Healthcare costs were compared across three frailty status, robust, prefrailty, and frailty. Both prefrailty (5 studies, Hedges’ g = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.33, p < 0.001) and frailty (5 studies, Hedges’ g = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.61-0.62, p < 0.001) were associated with significantly higher healthcare costs when compared with robustness. There was a high degree of heterogeneity. The risk of publication bias was considered to be low in funnel plots.
Conclusions
This systematic review and meta-analysis found a dose-response increase in the healthcare costs associated with frailty among community-dwelling older adults. Future research should recognize frailty as an important factor associated with increased healthcare costs.",

abstract = "Within policy and practice there is an increasing interest in the care of frail elders. However understanding of the experience and challenges of living and dying with frailty in older age is currently undeveloped. Frailty is often used as a synonym for the increasing infirmities that accompany ageing and the slow dwindling dying trajectory of many elders. However, there is little empirical work on the experience of being frail to inform social gerontological perspectives and welfare provision. Through analysis of repeated in-depth interviews over 17 months (2006–2008) with 17 frail elders living at home in the U.K., key factors that shape elders’ experience of being frail emerged. The study argues that the visible markers of functional limitations and the increasing social losses of old age bring finitude to the fore. To retain anchorage in this state of imbalance, frail elders work actively to develop and sustain connections to their physical environment, routines and social networks. This experience can be conceptualised as persistent liminality; a state of imbalance “betwixt and between” active living and clinically recognised dying. This paper highlights the precarious and often protracted dying trajectory of frail older people. Whilst it could be argued that developing into death in older age is part of a normal and successful course after a life long-lived, recognition of and support for older people deemed frail is lacking. Frail elders find themselves living in the margin between the Third and Fourth Age with little recognition of or support for the work of living and dying over time. This experience of frailty contests dominant cultural and welfare practices and policy frameworks that operate in binary modes: social or health; independent or dependent; living or dying.",

Care homes provide personal care and support for older people who can no longer be supported in the community. As part of a larger study of integrated working between the NHS and care homes we asked older people how they accessed health care services. Our aim was to understand how older people resident in care homes access health services using the Andersen model of health care access.
Methods
Case studies were conducted in six care homes with different socio-economic characteristics, size and ownership in three study sites. Residents in all care homes with capacity to participate were eligible for the study. Interviews explored how residents accessed NHS professionals. The Andersen model of health seeking behaviour was our analytic framework.
Findings
Thirty-five participants were interviewed with an average of 4 different conditions. Expectations of their health and the effectiveness of services to mitigate their problems were low. Enabling factors were the use of intermediaries (usually staff, but also relatives) to seek access. Residents expected that care home staff would monitor changes in their health and seek appropriate help unprompted.
Conclusions
Care home residents may normalise their health care needs and frame services as unable to remediate these which may combine to disincline older care home residents to seek care. Care access was enabled using intermediaries -either staff or relatives-and the expectation that staff would proactively seek care when they observed new/changed needs. Residents may over-estimate the health-related knowledge of care home staff and their ability to initiate referrals to NHS professionals.",

In addition, it has been suggested that women are more vulnerable to the negative effects of loneliness on health. Our aim was to analyze the effect of HPA-axis functioning as a mediator in the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function, and interactions depending on sex, in healthy older people. To do so, 86 healthy older people (52.3% female) from 60 to 80 years old (M = 67.44, SD = 4.37) completed the revised UCLA loneliness scale. A neuropsychological battery was administered to assess global cognition, processing speed, attention and executive function, working memory, and verbal memory immediate and delayed recall. Saliva samples were provided on two consecutive weekdays to obtain awakening and bedtime cortisol levels, the diurnal cortisol slope (DCS), and the area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg). Our results showed that loneliness was not directly associated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, loneliness was related to higher bedtime cortisol levels, but not to awakening cortisol, the DCS, or the AUCg. In addition, loneliness was associated with worse performance on attention and processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory immediate recall, via bedtime cortisol levels. Therefore, we suggest that HPA-axis functioning is one of the biological mechanisms that mediate the relationship between loneliness and poorer cognitive function.

Suicide in older people is a public health concern. Emergency nurses are ideally placed to identify suicide risk. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore emergency nurses’ knowledge, confidence and attitudes about suicide in older people.
Methods
This descriptive exploratory study was conducted in four emergency departments in Sydney, Australia. Data were collected using a 28-item survey from a convenience sample of emergency nurses. Descriptive quantitative statistics and conventional content analysis were performed. Ethics approval was provided.
Results
The response rate was 58% (n = 136); the majority were female with an average of seven years emergency experience. The majority (n = 124, 91%) reported that they frequently managed suicidal behaviour and recognized suicide as a common event (80%). 51% (n = 69) recognized that suicide was a common event for older people. Only 16% (n = 22) reported receiving suicide prevention training with 11% feeling confident in managing suicidal behaviour.
Conclusion
The findings contribute to the discourse on how suicide in older people is recognised by emergency nurses. Few nurses considered it a problem for older people and were not confident about their knowledge. There is a need for suicide prevention training as a priority particularly to identify risks in older people.",

Direct involvement in creative activities can have benefits in terms of improved attention and positive engagement for older people. We used the social return on investment (SROI) approach to explore the social and economic benefits of arts activities for older people living in residential homes in England.
Methods
We complied with the CHEERS checklist and followed the six stages of SROI as reported in the literature.
Results
We identified three main stakeholders: care home residents, care home personnel, and activity co-ordinators. For residents, the outcomes of interest were: community inclusion, mental and physical health, improved cognition and decreased social isolation. For care home personnel and activity co-ordinators the outcomes were: improved skills in caring for older people and increased confidence in using arts interventions. The analysis yielded an SROI of £1.20 for every £1 of expenditure. The sensitivity analysis revealed that when we consider a displacement rate of 15% for all the outcomes of all participating stakeholders, the Imagine study is unlikely to report a ratio that is less than £1.02 for every £1.00 invested.
Conclusions
Findings could inform policy decisions about investment in the arts and health or social care.",

abstract = "Background
Person-centred care is widely accepted in health policy as a central focus for health services. However, research studies indicate that, for nurses, the person-centred care of older people with cognitive impairment is challenging.
Aim
This study aimed to compare levels of person-centred care between wards and professional groups (ENs and RNs) providing tertiary hospital care of older people with cognitive impairment.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional survey design, using the 15-item Person-centredness of Older People with cognitive impairment in Acute Care (POPAC) survey instrument, was undertaken.
Results
Nurses working in hospital wards of a tertiary-level health service (n=240; RR=54.3%) responded. Person-centred care was rated lower in wards with higher patient turnover compared to wards with lower patient turnover. Person-centred care was rated higher by enrolled nurses compared to registered nurses.
Discussion
Hospital context, specifically high turnover wards, present a threat to person-centred care, possibly related to the limited time available to undertake the personal care and associated conversations that can enhance nurses’ knowledge of the person. ENs carry more responsibility for these tasks, possibly explaining the variability in person-centred scores between RNs and ENs. In comparison to other studies, nurses in this study had higher average scores for person-centred care, raising measurement as an important challenge in monitoring the implementation of person-centred care policy.
Conclusion
The focus on health service efficiency appears to pose a threat to nurses’ delivery of person-centred care. Further research into the variability between person-centred care of RNs and ENs, and investigation into the practices of other health disciplines would be valuable. Given the importance of person-centred care to the safety and quality of health services, the POPAC addresses the challenge of monitoring person-centred policy initiatives. However, self-report instruments should be balanced with other sources of information about practice.",

This study aims to determine the impact of grandchild care provision on elders’ mental health by self-comparison and longitudinal study design.
Method
Information of 2930 grandparents from the Study of Health and Living Status of the Middle-Aged and Elderly in Taiwan were analysed. Elders’ mental health was evaluated by Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale in both 2003 and 2007. Participants were divided into 4 groups based on their changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren from 2003 to 2007. Chi-square test was used to compare changes in elders’ individual characteristics and total CESD scores between and within groups. ANOVA was used to compare the means of elders’ depressive symptoms between groups while paired-t test was used to compare changes in elders’ depression symptoms from 2003 to 2007. Logistic regression was performed to determine the associations between elders' changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren and changes in depressive symptoms.
Results
Elders continuously caring for grandchildren or started to take care of grandchildren significantly felt happier and enjoyed life more than before and more than elders who do not provide grandchild care. Logistic regression analyses exploring the impact of grandchild care provision found that elders provided no grandchild care had worst mental health amongst all. Elders stopped providing grandchild care had significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms (OR=1.40) than elders provided no grandchild care at all time.
Discussion
By self-comparison, this study illustrates how taking care of grandchildren maintains elders’ mental health, especially against them from loneliness and depression.",

The aim of this article was to synthesize research findings about health care providers’ experiences of patient-centered care in the home setting.
Methods
This is a meta-synthesis of qualitative findings using the analytical method of meta-ethnography developed by Noblit and Hare. We performed a systematic literature search in seven databases and assessed potential studies against eligibility criteria and quality. Subsequently, 10 primary studies were included for analysis.
Results
The core theme “being a balance artist” emerged from the synthesis, incorporating the participants’ experiences when faced with conflicting and competing responsibilities and needs. Two subthemes—“balancing the older clients’ needs against organizational demands” and “balancing the older clients’ needs against professional standards”—further elaborated on this core theme.
Conclusion
Health care providers’ experiences indicate that organizational factors play a crucial role in shaping the conditions for patient-centered care for older people in the home setting.
Practice implications
To motivate and facilitate health care providers to move to a more patient-centered practice, it is important to expand the values of patient-centered care beyond the clinical encounter into the organization.",

Existing evidence on long-term psychotropic polypharmacy in older people is scarce despite serious safety concerns regarding this issue. This study aims to identify distinct trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use and to examine the association with the risk of mortality and unplanned hospitalization according to distinct trajectories.
Design
A retrospective longitudinal cohort study based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).
Setting and participants
A population-based study including 39,803 eligible participants aged 65 years or older who were newly prescribed oral psychotropic agents in 2004.
Measures
We assessed 5 years of monthly consumption of psychotropic agents among eligible participants and used group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct groups of longitudinal psychotropic use. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between distinct trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use and subsequent 1- and 3-year unplanned hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
Results
Among 39,803 eligible participants, we identified 5 trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use over a 5-year follow-up period: sustained intense (7.1%), moderate increasing (12.1%), decreasing (13.4%), slowly increasing (15.7%), and infrequent users (51.6%). Moderate increasing and sustained intense use were associated with significantly higher risks of unplanned hospitalization [moderate increasing use: hazard ratio [HR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.44; sustained intense use: HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.58] and all-cause mortality (moderate increasing use: HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.44; sustained intense use: HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12-1.56) than infrequent use. Similar results were observed at 3 years of follow-up.
Conclusions/Implications
Older people with moderately increasing and sustained intense use of psychotropic agents over time had higher risks of unplanned hospitalization and mortality. Tracking older people's use of psychotropic agents over time may help to identify individuals at greatest risk of unplanned hospitalization and mortality.",

We don´t know how positive emotions are being expressed by patients and health care providers in consultations. The aim of this study is to identify positive emotions expressed by older people and nurse assistants to discuss the function of these in the visits.
Method
This paper presents secondary analysis of consultations in the COMHOME project. In this pilot study, six transcribed consultations between nurse assistants and older people in home health care were analysed using a coding system for positive emotions with seven categories capturing both content and emotional intensity of positive affect.
Results
We found 114 expressions of positive emotions, 63% from nurse assistants and 37% from patients. Patients mostly expressed gratitude, indicating that patients are grateful for being helped. Nurse assistants mostly expressed Praise or Support, indicating that they gave their patients positive affirmation.
Conclusion
The praise and support given by nurse assistants to older people in home health care seemed effective in fostering relationships and maintaining patient resilience. Thus, we claim that emotional talk in communication also should include positive emotions.
Practice Implication
Teaching health care providers about the importance of expressions of positive emotions should be integrated in communication skills training.",

The burden of unrelieved pain experienced by older people and its associated high symptom and economic costs demands consideration of new strategies to better this condition. As the global uptake of digital technology increases, exploring its potential to impact positively on older peoples’ pain self-management practices warrants investigation. This integrative review aimed to evaluate the use of digital health technology for management of older people’s pain across care-settings. Searches were conducted to identify relevant English language studies published in CINHAL, Medline, Academic Search Complete, EMBASE, Cochrane library databases, and Google and Google Scholar websites. A total of 1003 papers were identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by three Phase II randomized controlled trials. These trials demonstrated the feasibility of computer based interactive or instructive video interventions however there was limited evidence to support their use for reduction of pain intensity and interference. Qualitative evidence demonstrated older people’s willingness to use mobile technologies (iPhone or digital pen) to help manage their pain, however, the need of device-use training and connectedness with clinicians were highlighted. In conclusion, there is some evidence that integrating digital health technology into older peoples’ pain self-management plan is feasible and acceptable. However, the provision of high-quality technological interventions informed by a thorough understanding of older people’s digital technology pain management needs is required to ensure greater integration of this technology in clinical practice.",

The sample includes 73,301 individuals, across 16 European countries taken from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). People being diagnosed of diabetes were more likely to be admitted to hospital than those without diabetes, although its effect dropped after controlling for clinical and functional complications. Largest asscociations were observed in women, people aged 50–65 years old, with medium educational level and medium household income. Diabetes was significant and positively related to mortality in the whole sample. Diabetes is significantly associated with mortality risk especially in males, oldest old people, low education and medium income people. These findings have important implications for public policies to reduce socioeconomic-related health inequalities.",

Despite increasing the efforts in increasing awareness about the benefits of PPE among the farm workers, a vast majority of the farm workers including pickers don't use the PPE. The present study examines health impacts of cotton harvesting in Pakistani Punjab along with the factors affecting the use of PPE among the cotton pickers. Cross-sectional data collected from Vehari district is used. The study estimates health cost and the use of PPE among the young and elder cotton pickers. Headache, sleeplessness, cough, flue/fever, skin and eyes problems are reported by the young and elder cotton pickers. Personal protective equipment is rarely used during picking. However, the young pickers relatively adopt more PPE compared to the elder cotton pickers. Health cost of cotton picking is US$2.96 and 3.06 per season during the year for the young and elder cotton pickers, respectively. Results of logit model show that health cost, age, education below 8th grade, perception of temporary impact and health problems are important determinants of adopting PPE among the cotton pickers. The findings of the study conclude that the use of PPE can be realized through proper training and education of cotton pickers and farm workers.",

Emergency department presentations by older people associated with mental health and drug and alcohol related conditions are increasing. However, the characteristics of presentations by older people in Australia are largely unknown. The aim of this research was to explore the characteristics of older people presenting with mental health and drug and alcohol conditions.
Procedures
We used a retrospective electronic medical record audit to explore all emergency department presentations by older people 65 years and over for mental health and drug and alcohol related conditions over a 12 month period. Data were described using descriptive statistics.
Finidngs
There were 40,093 presentations; 2% (n=900) were related to mental health or drug and alcohol related conditions. Presentations were mainly associated with primary mental or medical symptoms. The majority were female (n=471; 53%). Predominate conditions were cognitive impairment (n=234; 26%) and affective disorders (n=233; 26.0%). Sixty-three percent of patients were admitted to a hospital ward. Over the study period 106 patients (242 episodes of care) represented.
Principle conclusions
Given the ageing population and increasing prevalence for mental health and drug and alcohol conditions, strategies are required to better recognise these conditions to reduce the burden on the health care system and improve health for older people.",

Older people can experience swallowing difficulties because of co-morbidities, age-related physiological changes, and polypharmacy. To make medicines easier to swallow, many people will modify the medication dosage form e.g. split or crush tablets, and open capsules. Some of the challenges associated with administering medicines to older people, and issues with dosage form modification will be reviewed. Novel dosage forms in development are promising and may help overcome some of the issues. However, until these are more readily available, effective interdisciplinary teams, and improving patient health literacy will help reduce the risk of medication misadventures in older people.",

Falls are the most common cause of serious injuries and are a major health threat in the stratum of older population. Early detection of a fall is a key factor when trying to provide adequate care to elderly person who has suffered an accident at home. Therefore, the detection of falls in the elderly remains a major challenge in the field of public health. Specific actions aimed at the fall detection can provide urgent care which allows, on the other hand, drastically reduce the cost of medical care, and improve primary care service. In this paper, we present a support system for detecting falls of an elder person by the combination of a wearable wireless sensor node based on an accelerometer and a static wireless non-intrusive sensory infrastructure based on heterogeneous sensor nodes. This previous infrastructure called DIA (Dispositivo Inteligente de Alarma, in Spanish) is an AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) system that allows to infer a potential fall. This inference is reinforced for prompt attention by a specific sensorisation at portable node sensor in order to help distinguish between falls and daily activities of assisted person. The wearable node will not determine a falling situation, it will advice the reasoner layer about specific acceleration patterns that could, eventually, imply a falling. Is at the higher layer where the falling is determined from the whole context produced by mesh of fixed nodes. Experimental results have shown that the proposed system obtains high reliability and sensitivity in the detection of the fall.",

Medication adherence is a key factor of the therapy of chronic diseases in older people with chronic diseases. Inadequate health literacy results in poor health outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of health literacy on medication adherence to provide information for improving health outcomes in older people with chronic disease. This was a cross-sectional study of older people (people aged over 65 years) with chronic diseases in Korea taking one or more medications for 6 months and over from an academic referral medical center. Each patient completed a structured questionnaire by interview or self-report. Of the 291 older participants, 30.6% had high medication adherence. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis, health literacy was the strongest predictor of medication adherence (β=0.190, P=0.001). In addition, perceived health status, use of magnifying glass, and assistance with medication administration were also significant factors related to medication adherence. In conclusion, enhancing health literacy may improve medication adherence of older people with chronic disease. The development, implementation and evaluation of health literacy interventions for older people with chronic conditions are important to increase medication adherence and potentially improve patient outcomes. Such programs would also raise awareness of the impact of health literacy on patient outcomes. Furthermore, this could contribute to reducing health inequalities worldwide.",

abstract = "Purpose
The purpose of the study was to explore experiences of older people with cancer in ascertaining the attributes of a person-centred approach in sustaining hope and enabling human flourishing. This was a qualitative study comparing patients and professional experiences and perceptions of care across to ward settings.
Methods
Methods involved 10 semi-structured interviews conducted with patients and focus groups (n = 6) and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals. Three dissemination focus groups (n = 14) were also carried out with professionals to allow further analysis of the data.
Results
Two main themes were identified, including ‘Emotional adaptations of hope: wants and expectations’ and ‘Hope through belittling their illness’. Findings highlight the way hope is conveyed and the emphasis' accorded to issues such as societal perceptions, knowledge, expectations of care, life stage, relationships, identity, and emotions. Findings also reinforce the importance of maintaining hope, recognising the different ways hope is used, and enabling patients to flourish.
Conclusion
This study highlights how hope is facilitated through the interaction between patients and professionals and that the relational interactive stance. This current study establishes that hope seemed to be temporal, contextual and dynamic in nature, involving an ongoing process. Helping older people with cancer to understand their illness considering the situation of lives and experiences is essential to address expectations and wants.",

The number of older people is increasing rapidly and these demographical changes put a large stress on the health care system. Furthermore, as most older people wish to age-in-place, adequate ageing-in-place strategies become significantly important. Housing impacts health, therefore appropriate and comfortable housing is a key determinant to facilitate older people to age-in-place. One of the aspects of concern is thermal comfort; however, the thermal requirements of older people differ from those of young adults. They are also relatively vulnerable to thermal conditions outside the generally accepted range. This ’10 Questions' contribution addresses issues related to thermal comfort and ageing and argues that the current models for assessing thermal comfort are not sufficiently accurate to be used for older adults. It also discusses approaches to facilitate ageing-in-place including the use of smart home technologies. The paper is based on extensive literature review of numerous relevant studies relating to thermal comfort, physiological differences between older and younger people, the relationship between thermal environment, comfort and health, as well as housing design and smart home technologies for older people.",

As transport patterns, including car ownership and public transport, vary between countries; we focused our review on studies undertaken in the UK. We searched for studies in English language journals using health, social science, age- and transport-related databases, supplementing the searches with advice from researchers in the field. Ten studies, reported in 12 papers, met the inclusion criteria. The data, consisting of participant accounts and author interpretations, were analysed using thematic synthesis, an iterative process that moves from data-coding to descriptive themes and then to cross-cutting analytical themes. From this, three analytical themes were identified and refined through feedback from policy advisors. The first theme related to the experience of living with an inadequate transport system. The second and third themes highlighted the practical importance of everyday travel in enabling older people to maintain their lives and its symbolic importance in affirming valued identities. While everyday travel – on foot, by public and community transport and by car – facilitated access to health-related goods and services (for example, food shops and health services), it is its broader contribution to quality of life in older age that our review highlights.",

Prevention of problematic alcohol use is mainly focused on younger adults, while heavy drinking in middle-aged and older adults might be more frequent with more impact on functioning and health care use. Therefore, alcohol use and alcohol disorder in both age groups was compared. To facilitate age-specific prevention, it was examined whether risk factors of heavy drinking and impact on functioning and health care use differs across the life-span.
Methods
Data of people (23–70 years) were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (N = 4618), a general population-based cohort. Heavy alcohol use was defined as >14 drinks/week for women and >21 drinks/week for men. Alcohol disorder was defined as DSM-IV disorder of alcohol abuse and/or alcohol dependence. (Multinomial) logistic regression analyses were used to study risk factors of alcohol use and associations between alcohol use and health care use and functioning.
Results
The past-year prevalence of heavy alcohol was higher in older (55–70 years) compared to younger people (6.7% versus 3.8%), whereas alcohol disorder was less prevalent (1.3% versus 3.9%). Heavy alcohol use was associated with higher level of education in older adults compared to younger adults. Other characteristics of problematic alcohol use and its impact on functioning and health care use did not differ between age groups.
Conclusions
Heavy drinking is more prevalent among middle-aged and older people. Contrary to younger adults, prevention of heavy alcohol use in those aged 55–70 should focus on higher educated people.",

abstract = "Although the general population in China is physically active, only 45% of older adults meet the World Health Organization's recommendation for weekly moderate-to-vigorous exercise, to achieve health benefits. This percentage is even lower (9.8%) in urban China. It is, therefore, important to understand the pathways by which physical activity behaviors are impacted by the built environment. This study utilized a mixed methods approach—interviews (n = 42) and longitudinal (2010–2015) health survey data (n = 3094) for older people residing in three neighborhoods in Huainan, a mid-sized city in Anhui Province, central eastern China. First, a content analysis of interview data was used to identify individual and built environment factors (motivators and barriers) that impacted physical activity within older people's activity spaces. Second, a multilevel path analysis was conducted using the health survey data to demonstrate the pathways by which these motivators and barriers contributed to the initiation, regulation, and maintenance of physical activity. This study found (a) that the liveliness of an apartment building and its proximity to functional spaces (fast-food stores, farmer's markets, supermarkets, pharmacies, schools, hospitals, PA facilities and natural and man-made water bodies) were important factors in attracting sedentary older people to initiate physical activity; (b) the social networks of apartment neighbors helped to initiate, regulate, and maintain physical activity; and housing closeness to functional spaces was important in maintaining physical activity, particularly for those older people with chronic diseases. To increase older people's overall physical activity, future interventions should focus on residential form and access to functional spaces, prior to investing in large-scale urban design interventions.",

These have important implications for social protection systems. The goal of this paper is to model future functional disability and healthcare expenditures based on current trends. To project the health, disability and hospitalization spending of future elders, we adapted the Future Elderly Model (FEM) to Singapore. The FEM is a dynamic Markov microsimulation model developed in the US. Our main source of population data was the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) consisting of 63,000 respondents followed up over three waves from 1993 to 2010. The FEM model enables us to investigate the effects of disability compounded over the lifecycle and hospitalization spending, while adjusting for competing risk of multi-comorbidities. Results indicate that by 2050, 1 in 6 elders in Singapore will have at least one ADL disability and 1 in 3 elders will have at least one IADL disability, an increase from 1 in 12 elders and 1 in 5 elders respectively in 2014. The highest prevalence of functional disability will be in those aged 85 years and above. Lifetime hospitalization spending of elders aged 55 and above is US$24,400 (30.2%) higher among people with functional disability compared to those without disability. Policies that successfully tackle diabetes and promote healthy living may reduce or delay the onset of disability, leading to potential saving. In addition, further technological improvements may reduce the financial burden of disability.",

Background
Taiwan is an aging society by the definition of the World Health Organization. The trend of elder population is one of the fastest worldwide. The Taiwan Foundation for Geriatric Emergency and Critical Care dedicates to disseminate health promotion behaviors for community elders and middle age adults. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and satisfaction of the health education programs on health promotion behaviors.
Methods
A one-group pretest-posttest study was conducted using purposively sampling of participants of the health education programs at five community care centers in the great Taipei metropolitan area. A structure questionnaire was developed to collect data. SPSS 20.0 was used in statistical analysis.
Results
Above 40% of 136 participants were either overweight or obesity. Comparing pretest and posttest scores, the changes in mentality, perceived health, physical exercise, and blood pressure measurement were significant (p < 0.05). The overall satisfaction with the health education programs was high (3.62). It was found the correlation between marital status and perceived health was positive (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
The health education programs specifically for elders and middle age adults in community care centers were effective in raising the awareness of health promotion behaviors. The success could provide a reference for future studies developing health promotion and education programs and holistic care for community elders and middle age adults in Taiwan.",

Alzheimer disease (AD) can affect masticatory function, affecting oral health–related quality of life (OHRQoL). Whether oral rehabilitation with conventional removable prostheses can restore masticatory function and improve OHRQoL in these individuals is unknown.
Purpose
The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the influence of oral rehabilitation with removable prostheses on masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL in elders with and without AD.
Material and methods
Thirty-two elders with mild AD (n=16, mean age=76.7 ±6.3 years) or without AD (n=16, mean age=75.2 ±4.4 years) were recruited. All participants first underwent masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL evaluations, and 2 months after insertion of new removable prostheses, the variables were reassessed. Masticatory efficiency was determined using the sieving method, and OHRQoL was measured by applying the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). The data from the baseline and after insertion of the new removable prostheses were compared by paired t test. Group differences at each time point were assessed by t test (α=.05).
Results
After insertion of the new removable prostheses, masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL improved in both the elders with AD and the control. At baseline, elders with AD had lower masticatory efficiency and higher OHRQoL than controls (P<.05). After removable prosthesis insertion, elders with AD continued to show lower masticatory efficiency values than controls, but their OHRQoL was similar.
Conclusions
Oral rehabilitation with new removable prostheses improved the masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL of elders with and without AD, although masticatory efficiency did not reach control levels in elders with AD.",

The prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among older people is high. Screening for CRC presents a cost-effective secondary prevention and control strategy which results in a significant reduction in mortality. This study aims to describe the prevalence of CRC screening and examine its risk factors among Chinese community-dwelling older people guided by a comprehensive model combining Health Belief Model and Extended Parallel Processing Model.
Methods
A descriptive correlational study was conducted. A convenience sample of 240 community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 was recruited in May–July in 2012 in Hong Kong. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire which collected information on demographic variables, CRC-related psychosocial variables and whether they had a CRC screening in the past 10 years.
Results
Among the participants, 25.4% reported having a CRC screening test. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that participants with a higher level in cue to action, and lower perceived knowledge barriers and severity-fear were significantly associated with participation in CRC screening. But there were no significant associations between fatalism and cancer fear with screening.
Conclusions
The prevalence of CRC screening was low in Hong Kong Chinese community-dwelling elders. A number of modifiable factors associated with CRC screening were identified which provides specific targets for interventions. This study also adds to the knowledge regarding the associations between fatalism and fear with CRC screening behaviors among Chinese older people.",

abstract = "Background
An intervention ‘Better Oral Health in Home Care’ was introduced (2012–2014) to improve the oral health of older people receiving community aged care services. Implementation of the intervention was theoretically framed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Process outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in older people’s oral health.
Objective
To evaluate the extent to which the intervention has been embedded and sustained into routine community aged care practice 3 years after the initial implementation project.
Design
A Realist Evaluation applying Normalisation Process Theory within a single case study setting.
Setting
Community aged care (home care) provider in South Australia, Australia.
Participants
Purposeful sampling was undertaken. Twelve staff members were recruited from corporate, management and direct care positions. Two consumers representing high and low care recipients also participated.
Methods
Qualitative methods were applied in two subcases, reflecting different contextual settings. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and analysed deductively by applying the Normalisation Process Theory core constructs (with the recommended phases of the Realist Evaluation cycle). Retrospective and prospective analytic methods investigated how the intervention has been operationalised by comparing two timeframes: Time 1 (Implementation June 2012–December 2014) and Time 2 (Post-implementation July 2017–July 2018).
Results
At Time 1, the initial program theory proposed that multi-level facilitation contributed to a favourable context that triggered positive mechanisms supportive of building organisational and workforce oral healthcare capacity. At Time 2, an alternative program theory of how the intervention has unfolded in practice described a changed context following the withdrawal of the project facilitation processes with the triggering of alternative mechanisms that have made it difficult for staff to embed sustainable practice.
Conclusion
Findings concur with the literature that successful implementation outcomes do not necessarily guarantee sustainability. The study has provided a deeper explanation of how contextual characteristics have contributed to the conceptualisation of oral healthcare as a low priority, basic work-ready personal care task and how this, in turn, hindered the embedding of sustainable oral healthcare into routine community aged care practice. This understanding can be used to better inform the development of strategies, such as multi-level facilitation, needed to navigate contextual barriers so that sustainable practice can be achieved.",

Parkinson disease (PD) symptoms, such as muscle rigidity, tremors in the lips and tongue, and involuntary mandibular movements, may cause oral health-related problems, mastication difficulties, and denture discomfort because of the difficulty in controlling a prosthesis with the oral musculature.
Purpose
The purpose of this observational clinical study was to evaluate the influence of oral rehabilitation with a removable prosthesis on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and masticatory efficiency (ME) in elders with PD.
Material and methods
Thirty-four elders with PD (n=17, mean age 69.4 ±4.7 years) or without PD (n=17, mean age 70.7 ±4.7 years) were recruited. All participants first underwent OHRQoL and ME evaluations. Two months after the insertion of new removable prostheses, the participants were reassessed. The OHRQoL was measured with the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-49). ME was evaluated by determining the percentage weight of the comminuted silicone-based artificial material that passed through a 2.8 mm sieve. For each group, data were compared between baseline and after insertion of new removable prostheses by paired t test or Wilcoxon sign test/signed-rank test. Group differences were assessed at each time point by t test (α=.05).
Results
After the insertion of removable prostheses, elders with PD showed improved OHRQoL and ME. Controls also showed improvements on both measures after insertion of removable prostheses. At baseline, elders with PD had lower OHRQoL and ME compared with the controls (P<.05). After removable prosthesis insertion, the elders with PD continued to show lower ME values than the controls, but their OHRQoL was similar.
Conclusions
Oral rehabilitation with new removable dental prostheses improved the OHRQoL and ME in elders with and without PD, although ME did not reach control levels in elders with PD.",

Subjects completed a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, living arrangements, behavioral risk factors, health status, subjective assessments, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale.
Results
More than half of the participants were empty nest elders (57.4%). The overall prevalence of depressive symptom was 10.3%, while it was higher in empty nest group than in non-empty nest group (11.6% vs. 8.6%, P<0.001). A positive association was found between empty nest and depressive symptom, the OR (95%CI) was 1.223(1.045, 1.431). After stratified by gender/age/education level/employment status, this association was just prominent in participants of male, 70 years old and above, primary school education, and retirees. No matter living with spouse or living alone, empty nesters were more likely to have depressive symptoms than non-empty nesters.
Limitations
Cross-sectional study could not make a causation conclusion. The social supports of participants were not been investigated in detail.
Conclusions
Empty nest elders, especially those who are male, 70 years old and above, primary school education, and retired, are more vulnerable to depressive symptom.",

In one depopulated town (Ikeda, Nakagawa-gun, Hokkaido, Japan), volunteer residents have held Net Step Exercise classes throughout the town since 2007. We longitudinally examined the influence of volunteer-led Net Step Exercise class participation on subsequent self-rated health in all individuals aged 70–79 years living in Ikeda. A total of 662 people who completed a baseline mail-in questionnaire survey in 2012 were followed until 2014. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association with self-rated health after two years of class participation once a month or more at baseline, after controlling for confounds such as age, sex, years of education, living alone, baseline self-rated health, regular exercise, and other physical activities. The odds ratio of poor self-rated health in older people who participated in classes was 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.85) compared to older people not participating in classes. Even after confounding factors were adjusted, the odds ratio of class participation was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29–0.85). This study showed that participation in volunteer-led Net Step Exercise might prevent poor self-rated health. Such Net Step Exercise classes are a feasible method for older people’s health promotion in depopulated municipalities.",

When a disaster occurs older people are recognised to be among one of the vulnerable population groups. During the Great East Japan earthquake in 2011, there were numerous unresolved health and social issues for the survivors.
Aim of the study
To understand which challenges older people that survived the 2011 disaster faced, which aspects they identified as concerns and what they felt was difficult and possibly could not recover from in the near future.
Methods
A qualitative case study method was used. Sixteen participants, living in temporary housing, were interviewed in 2015. The interview data was analysed using thematic analysis.
Findings and discussion
Participants (4 men; 12 women) were aged between 65 and 89 years. Seven participants stated that they were healthy although they had minor health issues. Some women had psycho-social health issues brought about by the trauma they experienced, caring for their aging relatives and living in temporary housing. Four themes emerged: feeling grateful to be alive; issues related to health and mental health; the importance of recreational activities and community involvement; feeling of fear, uncertainty and vulnerability.
Conclusions
This is the first study to report directly participants’ feelings and views after their traumatic experience. All participants were happy to be interviewed and to express their views. Although participants expressed their need for health professional services to be available to support them following traumatic events, these services are yet to be recognised as an essential part of the recovery process.",

However, elders’ privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication. To show that elders’ privacy could be substantially exposed, in this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders’ movement activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS in deducing and disclosing elders’ privacy, which might be maliciously exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.",

abstract = "Background
Steadily increasing numbers of older people and people in need of care represent critical challenges for today’s society. In the last years, diverse (health-related) technologies have been developed to facilitate living at home for older people but also to support (professional) care personnel in their daily care efforts. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have the potential to enhance safety, support medical therapy, or facilitate everyday chores and social life. With the huge range and variety of technical opportunities, the question arises what influences (potential) users’ decisions for the right technology in their individual conditions and situations. In particular with regard to the fragility of the care situation, it is unknown which technologies are desired for different care needs and diverse situations.
Objectives
The present study investigates (1) personal care needs as a potential influencing parameter for technology acceptance and (2) the selection of specific technologies.
Method
In an online questionnaire (including n = 162 people of all ages), technology acceptance and the selection of specific technologies was assessed, using two scenarios differing in their personal care needs (low care needs vs. moderate care needs) in two situational contexts (emergency detection vs. medical reminders).
Results
Personal care needs influence the perception of benefits, barriers, and general acceptance of assisting technologies, independent from situational context. Higher needs for care lead to higher acknowledgements of the technology’s benefits, lower agreements or, in parts, higher rejections of potential barriers and higher acceptance. The two care situations differ regarding the participants’ preferences for technologies: For emergency detection, smart watches and emergency buttons are clearly accepted. In contrast, cameras are consistently rejected. For situations in which medical reminders are used, smartphone and smartwatches are most wanted, whereas audio assistants and smart TV were rather rejected.
Conclusions
The results provide insights into users’ preferences for specific technologies for the purpose of emergency detection and medical reminders as well as for the important influence of personal care needs. These insights can be used to derive user-tailored solutions of technology configurations for specific care needs and situations.",

Recent improved capabilities in both ambient and wearable technologies, especially those related with video and lifelogging data, and huge advances in the accuracy of intelligent systems for AAL are leading to more valuable and trustworthy services for older people and their caregivers. These advances have been particularly relevant in the last years due to the appearance of RGB-D devices and the development of deep learning systems. This article reviews these latest developments in the intersection of AAL, intelligent systems, lifelogging, and computer vision. This paper provides a study of previous reviews in these fields, and later analyses newer intelligent techniques employed with different video-based lifelogging technologies in order to offer lifelogging services for AAL. Additionally, privacy and ethical issues associated with these technologies are discussed. This review aims at facilitating the understanding of the multiple fields involved.",

Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed. Authors propose 1) sensor selection and application, 2) integration of a wireless sensor local network system, 3) design concept for IoT implementation, and 4) a big data analysis system model in this paper.",

The case study – dealing with the introduction of care robots in a care facility for the elderly – will be examined by an ethnographical qualitative analysis as well as by three theoretical approaches often used in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). We combine these three approaches with an ethnographical analysis to achieve a deeper understanding of several difficulties with pTD that are typical in the realization within the AAL field, especially when a mediating method, such as SBD, is adopted. In this respect the theoretical contribution consists of outlining the importance of a strictly bottom-up view on pTD. Finally, we conclude with two general recommendations on how the inclusion of care workers and older people as target groups of pTD within the AAL field can be accomplished more successfully.",

The need to support these elderly, in difficulty has prompted researchers to focus on the field of home care.

Hence, Quality Criteria (QCs) must be identified and well defined to successfully achieve the system purposes. The goal is to obtain a set of data quality characteristics that would be applicable to the context of AAL systems and evaluate them using data coming from multiple sensors. To do this, we based our work on ISO/IEC 25012 and ISO/IEC 25010 standards that establish QCs respectively on system and software product quality and data quality, to extract the most relevant QCs that could be more fitting for AAL systems. We have applied an approach to extract the most important criteria than can be associated with AAL system based on the acquisition, the transmission, and the treatment processes. To convince all stakeholders including both technologies and end users of AAL systems, high quality must be guaranteed, but measuring quality in AAL system is difficult because of the variety of stakeholders. To evaluate the entire data quality model for AAL system, we will apply an evaluation procedure on this model, which consists first make our model hierarchically, then evaluate it using the metrics based on the sensor data and the concept of fuzzy logic.",

Self-perceived health is a powerful predictor of mortality, physical morbidity, and disability among elderly people. Delivering culturally competent care is necessary for taking care of elders. Self-perceived health is a powerful predictor of mortality, physical morbidity, and disability among elderly people. Spiritual well-being has been found particularly important for older adults' overall health. This descriptive, correlational and predictive study used data that was collected from a convenience sample (N = 150) to examine the effects of spiritual well-being on the relationship between depression and self-perceived health, and to describe spiritual practices commonly used by Taiwanese elders. Findings from this study revealed that spiritual well-being was positively correlated with self-perceived health, negatively associated with depression, and significantly mediated the relationship between depression and self-perceived health. Relaxation and exercise were the most commonly used spiritual practices by Taiwanese elders. Findings from this study support the important role of spiritual well-being in elders' health and add to the body of knowledge about the spiritual practices used by Taiwanese elders. Nurses and health care providers should deliver culturally appropriate spiritual care to enhance spiritual well-being for elders to maintain good health for diverse elder population.",

abstract = "Background and objectives
Compared with other European countries, older people in Romania experience high rates of poverty and disability. In this, the first study to investigate wellbeing in older Romanian people attending public and third sector day facilities, we tested our hypotheses, based on a successful aging model, that greater wellbeing would be associated with a healthier lifestyle (lower levels of alcohol consumption and smoking), better physical health, mental health, social support (less loneliness) and absence of abuse.
Methods
Older people (65+) without significant cognitive impairment, recruited from three Bucharest social care centers, completed structured questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5).
Results
100/140 (71%) eligible potential participants approached participated; mean WHO-5 score was 67.7 (standard deviation=20.7); 25 (25%) scored <50, indicating low wellbeing. In our final model, lower depression (β=−0.40, t=−3.8, p<0.001) and loneliness scores (β=−0.22, t=−2.1, p=0.034) predicted higher wellbeing. More physical health problems and hospitalisations were associated with lower wellbeing on univariate analyses, but not in the final model. Screening positive for abuse (23 (23%) of participants), activities of daily living, alcohol and smoking status did not predict wellbeing.
Conclusions
Despite experiencing high rates of loneliness, depression, anxiety and abuse, this population of older, Romanian people receiving social support, reported wellbeing levels comparable to European working populations. Loneliness was a more important predictor of lower wellbeing than any other factors studied. Tailored interventions to reduce loneliness in Romanian older people receiving community social support would be a rational next step.",

A fall not assisted in time can cause functional impairment in an elder and a significant decrease in his mobility, independence and life quality. In that sense, the present work proposes an innovative IoT-based system for detecting falls of elderly people in indoor environments, which takes advantages of low-power wireless sensor networks, smart devices, big data and cloud computing. For this purpose, a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN device wearable is used, which is responsible for collecting data from movements of elderly people in real-time. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, the sensor readings are processed and analyzed using a decision trees-based Big Data model running on a Smart IoT Gateway. If a fall is detected, an alert is activated and the system reacts automatically by sending notifications to the groups responsible for the care of the elderly people. Finally, the system provides services built on cloud. From medical perspective, there is a storage service that enables healthcare professional to access to falls data for perform further analysis. On the other hand, the system provides a service leveraging this data to create a new machine learning model each time a fall is detected. The results of experiments have shown high success rates in fall detection in terms of accuracy, precision and gain.",

The purpose of this study is to determine Sundanese family habits in caring for older people with diabetes in Tasikmalaya, West Java, Indonesia.
Method
This study using a qualitative phenomenological method, via in-depth interviews, in which the saturation point was reached at the ten participants. The ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, maleficence, and justice were applied.
Results
This study identified two main topics: first, family ability to perform family health tasks and second, the different types of family cultures that influence taking care of the health of older people, which were reflected through several sub-topics, namely, pampering the parents, doing everything they asked, and controlling all their activities. The habits of pampering and assenting to the wishes of older people with diabetes are highly risky, as, when they are food-related, they can increase blood glucose.
Conclusion
The findings of this study reveal that the family habits which highly risky to increase blood glucose older people must be changed through negotiation efforts and cultural restructuring, such that the treatments provided are in accordance with the diabetes management pattern. The results of the present study are useful in improving health services for older people with diabetes in the multicultural country of Indonesia.",

In order to contribute to a greater overall functionality of the individual, the use of software and complex systems can be decisive to assist the people with special needs in all areas of life. The paradigm introduced with ICF is inclusive and universal, so it favors not only the old people, but all others, whether they have a limitation or not. The characteristics of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) are appropriate to fulfill elderly needs. However, the current state of development is still mostly oriented to a technological perspective, where the individual's functionality has not been fully addressed. Under the Living Usability Lab project we have defined a methodology and created some evaluation tools for assessment of AAL services according to a Living Lab perspective, based on the ICF.

In particular, we propose an algorithm based on a heuristic and machine learning to detect ‘long-lie’ situations. The proposed algorithm minimizes the effects of noise present in the RFID information by relying on eight features extracted using only binary tag observation information from a possible location of a fall on the smart carpet. By evaluating the proposed approach with broadly scripted activities, which included a complex set of walking patterns, we show that the proposed algorithm depicts a good overall performance of 93% F-score.",

With the case of Vietnam, this paper aimed to explore the productive activities among Vietnamese older people by using data from the Vietnam Aging Survey (VNAS), which was conducted in 2011 as the first-ever nationally representative survey on persons aged 50 and over in Vietnam and contained 2789 older people (those aged 60 and over) representing all older people living in 6 ecological regions and urban and rural areas in Vietnam. Productive activities included working and/or taking care of any (great)grandchild(ren) in the past 12 months prior to the survey. Using paired t-tests and probit models, we compared the differences in these productive activities among older people in terms of sex and living area. The results from various t-tests showed that educational attainment, health status and poverty status were key factors differentiating older men and women and rural and urban older people in these productive activities. For the probit estimations in terms of both gender and living location, the results indicated that age, education, health status and supportive children were determinants of working decision, while age, marital status and size of household were consistently important factors of taking care of (great)grandchildren. The paper also discussed policy implications for socio-economic and health protection in promoting older people's productive activities as well as protecting them from a variety of risks and vulnerabilities.",

abstract = "Background
It is well established that social exclusion is a key social determinant of health; however, such association between social exclusion and health outcomes among older people remain a relatively under-researched area. This paper explores the effects of four dimensions of social exclusion on self-rated health and depression among older people in China.
Methods
This paper includes 8038 individuals aged 60 and over from the first wave national multi-stage probability sample (2014) from the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS). Descriptive univariate information for individual variables and four dimensions of social exclusion are presented. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models are used to examine the associations between social exclusion and self-rated health and depression.
Results
Older people who were in the lower level of exclusion from social relationships or subjective feelings of exclusion were significantly less likely to report fair or poor self-rated health than people in the higher level of exclusion (lower level of exclusion from social activities was significantly associated with being less likely to report poor SRH only). Older people who were in the lower level of subjective feeling of exclusion or exclusion from financial products were significantly less likely to report depression.
Conclusions
Different dimensions of social exclusion have different effects on self-rated health and depression. Social policies need to reflect this and efforts of services could usefully be oriented to prevent multi-dimensions of social exclusion. Ultimately, such policies should have the potential to enhance the health of older people in China.",

abstract = "Background
Falls in older people is a global public health concern. Physical exercise is a useful and potentially cost-saving treatment option to prevent falls in older people.
Objectives
We aimed to (1) summarize the research literature regarding the cost-effectiveness of exercise-based programs for falls prevention in older people and (2) discuss the implications of the review's findings for clinical practice and future research on the dosage of cost-effective exercise-based falls prevention programs for older people.
Methods
Multiple databases were searched from inception until February 2019. Studies were included if they (1) were randomized controlled trials with an economic evaluation of exercise-based falls prevention programs for people ≥ 60 years old and (2) assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost per quality-adjusted life year, incremental cost per fall and benefit-to-cost ratio of programs. Methodological quality was assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and quality of economic evaluation with the Quality of Health Economic Studies.
Results
We included 12 studies (3668 older people). Interventions for falls prevention were either exercise-only or multifactorial programs. Five studies of high economic quality and 2 of high methodological quality provided evidence supporting exercise-only programs as cost-effective for preventing falls in older people. Specifically, a tailored exercise program including strengthening of lower extremities, balance training, cardiovascular exercise, stretching and functional training of moderate intensity performed twice per week with each session lasting 60min for ≥ 6 months delivered in groups of 3 to 8 participants with home-based follow-up appears to be cost-effective in preventing falls in older people.
Conclusion
There is evidence to support exercise-based interventions as cost-effective treatment for preventing falls. Further research is needed to fully establish the cost-effectiveness of such programs, especially in both developing and underdeveloped countries.

abstract = "Introduction
Elder abuse (abuse/violence/neglect or disrespect as defined by BKPAI data) among elderly is a deserted and overlooked issue especially in developing countries including India.
Aim
To assess the elder abuse and its association with socio-demographic factors among elderly population.
Materials and Methods
This study comprises data from BKPAI 2011. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis have been used for the following study.
Results
A total of 9852 elderly people were included in this study which was carried out in seven states of India. The mean age of the study subjects was 68.04±7.29 years. Among 9852 elderly people 10% (987) were faced elder abuse. In unadjusted odd-ratio the status of elder abuse was found statistically significant with state, type of residence, sex, age group, caste, education, marital status, migration status, occupation, health condition and economic dependency etc. But in binary logistic regression analysis state, type of residence, sex, education, caste and their migration status were found statistically significant with elder abuse.
Conclusion
From the result of this study, the existence of “violence”, “neglect”, and “disrespect” within the society and community is approved. The problems of abuse among older persons were more mental than physical and elderly at getting older, without partner, with bad health condition, having less money or with no security are on more risk of getting abused.",

Results indicate that the loss of labor due to migration has a significantly negative effect on the health of left-behind elders, but remittances from migrants can compensate for the adverse effect. This study provides a comprehensive understanding that remittances from migration relax the constraints on household resource allocations in undeveloped rural areas with imperfect market conditions.

abstract = "In recent years several world-wide ambient assisted living (AAL) programs have been activated in order to improve the quality of life of older people, and to strengthen the industrial base through the use of information and communication technologies. An important issue is extending the time that older people can live in their home environment, by increasing their autonomy and helping them to carry out activities of daily livings (ADLs). Research in the automatic detection of falls has received a lot of attention, with the object of enhancing safety, emergency response and independence of the elderly, at the same time comparing the social and economic costs related to fall accidents. In this work, an algorithmic framework to detect falls by using a 3D time-of-flight vision technology is presented. The proposed system presented complementary working requirements with respect to traditional worn and non-worn fall-detection devices. The vision system used a state-of-the-art 3D range camera for elderly movement measurement and detection of critical events, such as falls. The depth images provided by the active sensor allowed reliable segmentation and tracking of elderly movements, by using well-established imaging methods. Moreover, the range camera provided 3D metric information in all illumination conditions (even night vision), allowing the overcoming of some typical limitations of passive vision (shadows, camouflage, occlusions, brightness fluctuations, perspective ambiguity). A self-calibration algorithm guarantees different setup mountings of the range camera by non-technical users. A large dataset of simulated fall events and ADLs in real dwellings was collected and the proposed fall-detection system demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity.",

In this paper, we present two data-driven models (a field study model and a lab study model) using the algorithm of random forests to predict older people's thermal sensation.

The field study dataset was collected from 1040 old subjects (70 + years) who lived in 19 aged-care homes, which contains multi-dimension factors such as environmental parameters, subjects' demographic information, health condition, acclimatization degrees, living habits and thermal perceptions' votes. The lab study dataset was collected from a lab study and contains 18 old subjects' (65 + years) eight local skin temperatures and thermal perceptions' votes under five thermal environments (21/23/26/29/32 °C). After the procedure of feature selection, the field study model was developed with four environmental variables (air temperature, velocity, CO2 concentration, illuminance) plus two human-related variables (health condition and living time in aged-care homes) as inputs. It produced an overall accuracy of 56.6%, which was 24.9% higher than that of the PMV model. The lab study model was built on five local skin temperatures including head, lower arm, upper leg, chest and back temperatures, which demonstrated an overall accuracy of 76.7%, 30.1% higher than UC Berkeley thermal sensation model's accuracy. We then interpreted how these inputs distinguish thermal sensations by applying a partial dependence analysis. Finally, we proposed two applications of the above models and present older people's seasonally neutral indoor temperature zones.",

In the past century, elder abuse has become an important health issue and a stressful event that negatively affects the physical and mental health of the elders.
Aims
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of elder abuse in Iran through systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
All articles about elderly abuse in Iran since 2005–2017 were searched using the Google Scholar search engine, four Iranian databases (Magiran, IranMedex, SID) and six international English language databases(Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Pubmed, Science Direct-Embase) with keywords of Elder Abuse, Elder Mistreatment, Elder Neglect, Abuse and a combination of these keywords. After examining the entry and exit criteria and qualitative evaluation of the articles, Data was analyzed by comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software.
Findings
In a systematic review, 15 articles on elders in Iran were included in the study. The overall prevalence of elder abuse was 48.3% (with 95% confidence interval: 28.6–68.6) and the highest prevalence of elder abuse was related to the care neglect dimensionat the prevalence rate of 38.4% (with 95% confidence interval: 21.7–51.6) and the lowest prevalence rate of elder abuse was related to the rejection atthe prevalence rate of 11% (with 95% confidence interval: 6.9–17.1).
Conclusion
The prevalence of elder abuse among elders was high in Iran. Considering the growing elderly population in Iran, preventive measures should be considered in this regard. For this reason, community health nurses are required to provide the elderly, family and community with necessary preventive interventions in this regard.",

Objective
The purpose of this study was to systematically review the existing literature regarding Nature – Based Activities addressed to older people.
Methods
A systematic search of the literature was made in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus from 2005 till December 2018.
Results
We identified 42 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The results highlighted the multidisciplinary use of nature in many settings as well as a variety of different research designs, both quantitative and qualitative. The majority of experimental assessments were carried out in the setting of nursing homes and residential facilities. A variety of treatments, e.g. horticultural therapy, gardening, green visiting, green exercise and of settings, e.g. residential facilities or adult day services, participants’ homes, outdoor settings, and green care farms were examined.
Conclusions
The examined studies offered numerous examples of the healing power of nature for the health and well-being of older people. Occupational therapists could gain substantial insight from earlier experiences of NBA for application in their practices.",

All factors were preferentially associated with slowness. The Mediterranean diet and social participation were additionally associated with weakness and low activity, respectively. To reduce the risk of frailty among diverse populations of older people in community settings, eliminating foods considered detrimental in the Mediterranean diet is advocated. Older people's satisfaction with social participation should be taken into consideration. Environmental designs should accommodate slow-walking older people to maximize their life-space",

The magnitude of the issue and known barriers to addressing it through formal systems necessitate innovative approaches to identification and response. This study explores network composition change following elder mistreatment in order to assess the viability of leveraging network members in future intervention efforts. Multiply imputed linear regression models show associations between elder mistreatment and small increases in net change and the number of specific network additions. No association between elder mistreatment and network member losses or network density were found. These findings highlight the complexity of social network change in older adulthood and point to a need for future research considering the influence of Adult Protective Service intervention as well as qualitative work assessing older adults’ own perceptions of mistreatment and network change.",

The number of Seniors Councils in Poland has grown in recent years thanks to favorable legislative changes in 2013 and 2015. Since 2015, the local executive administration is obliged to establish a Seniors Council if there is local demand for such a council. The influence of senior councils is likely to grow over the coming years, given the ageing of the population and the related increasing importance of older citizens in the electorate, especially for local political leaders. Seniors Councils can support better informed local decision-making by helping to identify local needs and contributing to a better allocation of scarce resources. They may also help to draw more resources to health promotion and primary prevention for older people in an environment of financial constraints and a health care system that traditionally prioritizes curative care.",

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for periodontitis for over 40 years and novel evidence suggests that periodontitis has an impact on glycemic control in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to compare oral health complications in diabetic older patients from Brazil and France.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 120 patients aged 65 and over diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Sixty patients were admitted to a center for diabetes and hypertension care in Brazil and 60 patients were admitted to the Rouen University hospital. Dental conditions were assessed through the decayed, missing and filled teeth index and periodontal condition was assessed using the Community Periodontal Index. The significance threshold was p < 0.05.
Results
Decayed teeth differed statistically between the groups (p = 0.001). The French group presented more tooth mobility, gingival recession and furcation involvement (p < 0.001). Tooth brushing frequency differed significantly between the groups (p < 0.030). The main cause of missing teeth was periodontitis in the French group and caries and periodontitis in the Brazilian group (p < 0.001). Statistical significance was found for use of fixed upper (p = 0.013) and lower (p = 0.013) dentures in the French group. The French group needed upper denture rehabilitation (p = 0.010) while the Brazilian group needed lower denture rehabilitation (p = 0.003).
Conclusion
Edentulism was prevalent in diabetic older people in both countries. However, the French participants presented with better oral health.",

Two exceptions include Senegal's Plan Sesame, a user fees exemption for older people and Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) where older people are exempt from paying premiums. Evidence on whether older people are aware of and enrolling in these schemes is however lacking. We aim to fill this gap. Besides exploring economic indicators, we also investigate whether social exclusion determines enrolment of older people. This is the first study that tries to explore the social, political, economic and cultural (SPEC) dimensions of social exclusion in the context of social health protection programs for older people. Data were collected by two cross-sectional household surveys conducted in Ghana and Senegal in 2012. We develop SPEC indices and conduct logistic regressions to study the determinants of enrolment. Our results indicate that older people vulnerable to social exclusion in all SPEC dimensions are less likely to enrol in Plan Sesame and those that are vulnerable in the political dimension are less likely to enrol in NHIS. Efforts should be taken to specifically enrol older people in rural areas, ethnic minorities, women and those isolated due to a lack of social support. Consideration should also be paid to modify scheme features such as eliminating the registration fee for older people in NHIS and creating administration offices for ID cards in remote communities in Senegal.",

Polypharmacy is associated with inappropriate medication use, and subsequently increasing older persons’ risk of drug-related harm and health-related costs to individuals and society.
Objective
To examine and describe, using a national sample of patient-level medication data, the prevalence of older people's polypharmacy and medication use across dependency levels. To examine oral and general pain prevalence and associated analgesic usage.
Methods
Medication data from the 2012 New Zealand Older People's Oral Health Survey, a nationally-representative, cross-sectional study of dependent older people's oral health, were analysed descriptively, comparing classes and sub-classes of drugs and nutrient supplements taken across four categories of dependency: very low (own homes receiving in-home support), low, high and psychogeriatric (all receiving aged residential care). Self-reported current general pain and frequency of orofacial pain data were cross-tabulated by sub-classes of analgesics taken.
Results
All participants were taking at least one medication overall, 53.2% (95% CI: 50.4, 56.0) took between five and nine (polypharmacy), and 13.9% (95% CI: 17.4, 22.5) took 10 or more (hyperpolypharmacy). Antihypertensives, analgesics, antiulcer drugs, aspirin, laxatives, statins and antidepressants were the most common drug classes taken, the proportions differing between psychogeriatric level care and all other dependency groups. Overall, simple analgesics were taken (34.5%; 95%CI: 30.8, 38.4) more commonly than other analgesics; the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was low (3.6%; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.7). Of those reporting experiencing extreme general bodily pain, 63.3% (95% CI: 56.6, 69.4) took an analgesic, more than those experiencing mouth pain occasionally or often. Fat-soluble vitamins were the most common vitamin supplement taken (32.0%; 95%CI: 27.0, 37.4).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy are common among older people, regardless of dependency level, and pain may be undertreated.",

Population ageing has become a public health issue as it is associated with increased morbidity, institutionalization and death. These may directly affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of older people.
Purpose
The aim of the study was to investigate HRQOL and its associated factors among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district, Sri Lanka.
Method
This cross-sectional survey involved 1300 older people. The Euro 5D-3L, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, body mass index, handgrip strength were used to measure HRQOL, physical activity and nutritional status of older people respectively. Factors associated with health-related quality of life were identified through complex sample logistic regression analysis.
Results
Majority of older people (81.9%) reported poor health-related quality of life. Middle old (aOR: 12.06, 95% CI: 5.76, 25.23), very old (aOR: 174.74, 95% CI: 39.74, 768.38), vegetarian diets (aOR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.96), under-nutrition (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.65, 7.04) and over-nutrition (aOR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.28) were significantly associated with poor HRQOL. Using dentures (aOR: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.90) was found as a protective factor for poor HRQOL.
Conclusions
HRQOL was poor among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district. Nutrition-related factors need to be further investigated to improve HRQOL among older people.",

Elder abuse in recent times has reached a remarkable international importance. This complex phenomenon is still little understood and studied in Italy. The aim of this study was to explore Italian healthcare professionals’ attitude and barriers toward elder abuse, with a glimpse on the current scenario and evidences to develop an action plan.
Materials and methods
42 healthcare professionals filled a questionnaire with 13 open-ended questions, analyzed with a qualitative content analysis. Data were grouped under the following 4 core-themes: description of elder abuse, abuse detection and perception, barriers to reporting, and professional orientation and approach; then they were analyzed to find their central component and discussed jointly.
Results
The respondents described physical (64%) and psychological (50%) abuse and neglect (50%) as the three main characteristics of elder abuse; the 59% of them reported at least one experience in detecting or suspecting elder abuse. The 76% of participants believed the report has to be submitted to the Judicial Authority only in presence of compelling evidences. Furthermore, the 73% of the sample perceived that healthcare professionals are the main figures who have to cope with elder abuse, however they did not feel as their exclusive role the assessment of the patients’ potential abuse.
Conclusion
Knowledge about elder abuse was limited to physical/psychological issues and, moreover, the legal obligation to report was only poorly known. Imperative is the creation of specific education and training courses, in addition to the need for a multidisciplinary and empathetic approach.",

abstract = "Purpose
This paper describes proposed health care services innovations, provided by a system called CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisted Living eXperiment). CAALYX aimed to provide healthcare innovation by extending the state-of-the-art in tele-healthcare, by focusing on increasing the confidence of elderly people living autonomously, by building on the knowledge base of the most common disorders and respective characteristic vital sign changes for this age group.
Methods
A review of the state-of-the-art on health care services was carried out. Then, extensive research was conducted on the particular needs of the elderly in relation to home health services that, if offered to them, could improve their day life by giving them greater confidence and autonomy. To achieve this, we addressed issues associated with the gathering of clinical data and interpretation of these data, as well as possibilities of automatically triggering appropriate clinical measures. Considering this initial work we started the identification of initiatives, ongoing works and technologies that could be used for the development of the system. After that, the implementation of CAALYX was done.
Findings
The innovation in CAALYX system considers three main areas of contribution: (i) The Roaming Monitoring System that is used to collect information on the well-being of the elderly users; (ii) The Home Monitoring System that is aimed at helping the elders independently living at home being implemented by a device (a personal computer or a set top box) that supports the connection of sensors and video cameras that may be used for monitoring and for interaction with the elder; (iii) The Central Care Service and Monitoring System that is implemented by a Caretaker System where attention and care services are provided to elders, where actors as Caretakers, Doctors and Relatives are logically linked to elders. Innovations in each of these areas are presented here.
Conclusions
The ageing European society is placing an added burden on future generations, as the ‘elderly-to-working-age-people’ ratio is set to steadily increase in the future. Nowadays, quality of life and fitness allows for most older persons to have an active life well into their eighties. Furthermore, many older persons prefer to live in their own house and choose their own lifestyle. The CAALYX system can have a clear impact in increasing older persons’ autonomy, by ensuring that they do not need to leave their preferred environment in order to be properly monitored and taken care of.",

A purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit older people with chronic illness from one community in Nakhonratchasima province, Thailand. Semi-structured interview guides were used to explore the participants' experiences and perceptions. Data saturation was reached after 30 interviews were completed. The data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Four themes emerged from the data: 1) living a restricted life, 2) feeling overwhelmed, 3) understanding and accepting loss, and 4) being kind to oneself and learning to live with the disease. The findings may increase understanding about what older people with chronic illness experience. Health care providers can use this understanding to relate health care and guidance to their patients by incorporating cultural influences and religious/spiritual beliefs into the standardized care for this population.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify, critically appraise and synthesize qualitative evidence of self-care experiences in health promotion for home-dwelling elders.
Design
A meta-synthesis was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines and using Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument Software.
Data sources
The literature search was conducted on PubMed, CINHAL, Embase, PsycInfo, Eric and ILISI databases from inception up until March 2015. Other articles were searched on Scopus and Web of Knowledge. The reference list of all the identified articles was also searched for additional studies. Studies published in English, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were considered for inclusion in the review.
Review methods
Data from the selected qualitative articles were extracted independently by two reviewers using the data extraction tool of the Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. The meta-synthesis involved the following three steps: the production of a set of statements representing the aggregated data obtained by assembling the findings of qualitative studies; the categorization of findings on the basis of similarity in meaning; and the aggregation of these categories to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. No studies were excluded due to methodological quality.
Results
Of the 4001 records identified, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most articles were conducted in Scandinavian countries and used a phenomenological design. Most elders in the sample were middle-class, cognitively intact, independent, and in good health. The meta-synthesis revealed that older people living at home make decisions about their self-care activities on the basis of their attitudes toward their life and future. These self-care activities are directed toward holistic wellness, prevention and treatment of aging effects, obtaining a sense of satisfaction, and self-realization. Furthermore, self-care activities are settled in a social and relational network that allows old people to take care of themselves and of others or to be cared for by others.
Conclusions
This meta-synthesis presents the perspectives of home-dwelling old people on health-promoting self-care experiences. Such information can help healthcare professionals to maintain long-term autonomy of elders in self-care and to promote healthy aging. Further qualitative research describing self-care experiences of home-dwelling elders from different cultures, education levels, and social backgrounds is needed.",

The study used a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system to survey 250 people aged 65 years and over who lived in their own home. The respondents were recruited from three regions representing the three climate zones in South Australia: semi-arid, warm temperate and temperate. The results show that while the majority of respondents reported being in good health, many lived in dwellings with minimal shading and no wall insulation and appeared to rely on the use of heaters and coolers to achieve thermally comfortable conditions. Concerns over the cost of heating and cooling were shared among the majority of respondents and particularly among people with low incomes. Findings from this study highlight the importance of providing information to older people, carers, designers and policy makers about the interrelationships between weather, housing design, heating and cooling behaviours, thermal comfort, energy use and health and well-being, in order to support older people to age in place independently and healthily.",

abstract = "Background and purpose
There has been much discussion about the risk factors for osteoporosis, but studies involving elderly population in Taiwan are minimal. We aimed to describe variables related to osteoporosis among community dwelling older people in Taiwan.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study. The 671 participants were randomly selected from 3680 examinees of the annual Senior Citizens Health Examination in year 2010. Participants were interviewed with a detailed questionnaire, and 91 of them were invited for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Predictor variables included age, gender and clinical risk factors for osteoporosis. The main outcome was osteoporosis confirmed by DXA.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 75.7±6.4years old. Overall, the most prevalent variables for osteoporosis were height loss in adulthood (41.0%), lack of dairy products or calcium supplements (32.0%) and insufficient physical activity (10.4%). In multivariate models, we found that underweight (OR=9.80) and lack of dairy products/calcium supplements (OR=3.68) were the main variables for osteoporosis. In the subgroup analysis involving only women, underweight (OR=14.60) was the main variable.
Discussion
Among community-dwelling older people in Taiwan, osteoporosis was mainly associated with underweight and lack of dairy products or calcium supplements.
Conclusion
We suggest using the key questions of underweight and dietary pattern in clinical settings to identify high risk people who are candidates for further BMD exam.",

Results
A majority of Japanese elders (79%) agreed with unified guidance in combination with the issue of health insurance cards at age 65 or 75. The most preferred method for receiving information was video presentation.
Conclusions
Japanese elders appear to welcome the idea of receiving information about AD when they are issued health insurance cards at age 65 or 75. Use of video materials holds great promise for educating elderly Japanese about their choices on AD.",

abstract = "Purpose
To explore the combined effect of trends in older people on their future healthcare utilisation.
Methods
A Delphi study consisting of two rounds was conducted. The heterogeneous expert panel (n = 16) in the field of elderly care rated the effect of combinations of trends in the Netherlands on the use of seven healthcare services: i.e. informal, home, general practitioner, acute, specialist, nursing home and mental health care. The percentage and direction of the overall consensus, for the different health services, and for three main trends were analysed.
Results
Experts reached consensus in 57 of 92 ratings (62%). Taking into account the interaction between trends, they expected an extra increase for informal, home, and general practitioner care, but no additional effect of interaction for specialist and acute care. Combinations that included trends leading to less support were expected to lead to an extra increase in utilisation.
Conclusions
Experts expect that interaction between trends will lead to an extra increase in the use of general practitioner, home, and informal care. This increase is mainly the result of interaction with trends leading to less support for older persons. The present results show the need to take the effect of interaction into account when designing new health policy and in research on future healthcare utilisation.",

Twenty community-dwelling people of advanced age (85+) were recruited in 2015–16 from a large multidisciplinary longitudinal study of advanced age. These twenty participated in interviews about health in advanced age, impact of illnesses, interactions with clinicians, access to information, support for managing health, and perceptions of primary care, medications, and other forms of assistance. We use a positioning theory framework drawing on thematic and narrative analysis to understand the dynamic ways people in advanced age position themselves and the ways they age well through speech acts and storylines. People in advanced age saw themselves as challenged, rather than threatened, by adversities, and positioned themselves as able to draw on a lifetime of experience and resourcefulness and collaborations with supporters to deal with challenges. Key strategies include downplaying illness and resisting biomedical discourses of complexity, positioning embodied selves as having agency, and creative adaptation in the face of loss. People in advanced age exhibit resilience, maintaining wellbeing, autonomy and good physical and mental quality of life even while living with challenges such as functional decline and multi-morbidities. These findings have significance for supporters of older people, emphasising the need to move away from a narrow focus on problems to working together WITH people in advanced age to offer a more holistic approach that encourages and enhances adaptation and flexibility, rather than rigid and counterproductive coping patterns.",

abstract = "Background
Although frailty of older people has been shown to be associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, evidence on healthcare costs associated with frailty is scarce.
Methods
Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and AMED were electronically searched in January 2019 based on a protocol in accordance with the PRISMA statement using Medical Subjective Heading and free text terms, with explosion functions. Language restriction was not applied. Studies were considered if they were published between 2000 to January 2019 and provided healthcare costs stratified by the frailty status categories among community-dwelling older people with a mean age of 60 years or higher. Reference lists of the included studies were reviewed for additional studies. Healthcare costs according to frailty status were compared using standardized mean difference random-effects meta-analysis.
Results
The systematic review found 3116 citations. After screening for title, abstract, and full-text for eligibility, 5 studies involving 3742362 participants were included. Healthcare costs were compared across three frailty status, robust, prefrailty, and frailty. Both prefrailty (5 studies, Hedges’ g = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.33, p < 0.001) and frailty (5 studies, Hedges’ g = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.61-0.62, p < 0.001) were associated with significantly higher healthcare costs when compared with robustness. There was a high degree of heterogeneity. The risk of publication bias was considered to be low in funnel plots.
Conclusions
This systematic review and meta-analysis found a dose-response increase in the healthcare costs associated with frailty among community-dwelling older adults. Future research should recognize frailty as an important factor associated with increased healthcare costs.",

However understanding of the experience and challenges of living and dying with frailty in older age is currently undeveloped. Frailty is often used as a synonym for the increasing infirmities that accompany ageing and the slow dwindling dying trajectory of many elders. However, there is little empirical work on the experience of being frail to inform social gerontological perspectives and welfare provision. Through analysis of repeated in-depth interviews over 17 months (2006–2008) with 17 frail elders living at home in the U.K., key factors that shape elders’ experience of being frail emerged. The study argues that the visible markers of functional limitations and the increasing social losses of old age bring finitude to the fore. To retain anchorage in this state of imbalance, frail elders work actively to develop and sustain connections to their physical environment, routines and social networks. This experience can be conceptualised as persistent liminality; a state of imbalance “betwixt and between” active living and clinically recognised dying. This paper highlights the precarious and often protracted dying trajectory of frail older people. Whilst it could be argued that developing into death in older age is part of a normal and successful course after a life long-lived, recognition of and support for older people deemed frail is lacking. Frail elders find themselves living in the margin between the Third and Fourth Age with little recognition of or support for the work of living and dying over time. This experience of frailty contests dominant cultural and welfare practices and policy frameworks that operate in binary modes: social or health; independent or dependent; living or dying.",

abstract = "Background
Care homes provide personal care and support for older people who can no longer be supported in the community. As part of a larger study of integrated working between the NHS and care homes we asked older people how they accessed health care services. Our aim was to understand how older people resident in care homes access health services using the Andersen model of health care access.
Methods
Case studies were conducted in six care homes with different socio-economic characteristics, size and ownership in three study sites. Residents in all care homes with capacity to participate were eligible for the study. Interviews explored how residents accessed NHS professionals. The Andersen model of health seeking behaviour was our analytic framework.
Findings
Thirty-five participants were interviewed with an average of 4 different conditions. Expectations of their health and the effectiveness of services to mitigate their problems were low. Enabling factors were the use of intermediaries (usually staff, but also relatives) to seek access. Residents expected that care home staff would monitor changes in their health and seek appropriate help unprompted.
Conclusions
Care home residents may normalise their health care needs and frame services as unable to remediate these which may combine to disincline older care home residents to seek care. Care access was enabled using intermediaries -either staff or relatives-and the expectation that staff would proactively seek care when they observed new/changed needs. Residents may over-estimate the health-related knowledge of care home staff and their ability to initiate referrals to NHS professionals.",

Our aim was to analyze the effect of HPA-axis functioning as a mediator in the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function, and interactions depending on sex, in healthy older people. To do so, 86 healthy older people (52.3% female) from 60 to 80 years old (M = 67.44, SD = 4.37) completed the revised UCLA loneliness scale. A neuropsychological battery was administered to assess global cognition, processing speed, attention and executive function, working memory, and verbal memory immediate and delayed recall. Saliva samples were provided on two consecutive weekdays to obtain awakening and bedtime cortisol levels, the diurnal cortisol slope (DCS), and the area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg). Our results showed that loneliness was not directly associated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, loneliness was related to higher bedtime cortisol levels, but not to awakening cortisol, the DCS, or the AUCg. In addition, loneliness was associated with worse performance on attention and processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory immediate recall, via bedtime cortisol levels. Therefore, we suggest that HPA-axis functioning is one of the biological mechanisms that mediate the relationship between loneliness and poorer cognitive function. No sex differences were observed in these associations.",

Suicide in older people is a public health concern. Emergency nurses are ideally placed to identify suicide risk. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore emergency nurses’ knowledge, confidence and attitudes about suicide in older people.
Methods
This descriptive exploratory study was conducted in four emergency departments in Sydney, Australia. Data were collected using a 28-item survey from a convenience sample of emergency nurses. Descriptive quantitative statistics and conventional content analysis were performed. Ethics approval was provided.
Results
The response rate was 58% (n = 136); the majority were female with an average of seven years emergency experience. The majority (n = 124, 91%) reported that they frequently managed suicidal behaviour and recognized suicide as a common event (80%). 51% (n = 69) recognized that suicide was a common event for older people. Only 16% (n = 22) reported receiving suicide prevention training with 11% feeling confident in managing suicidal behaviour.
Conclusion
The findings contribute to the discourse on how suicide in older people is recognised by emergency nurses. Few nurses considered it a problem for older people and were not confident about their knowledge. There is a need for suicide prevention training as a priority particularly to identify risks in older people.",

Direct involvement in creative activities can have benefits in terms of improved attention and positive engagement for older people. We used the social return on investment (SROI) approach to explore the social and economic benefits of arts activities for older people living in residential homes in England.
Methods
We complied with the CHEERS checklist and followed the six stages of SROI as reported in the literature.
Results
We identified three main stakeholders: care home residents, care home personnel, and activity co-ordinators. For residents, the outcomes of interest were: community inclusion, mental and physical health, improved cognition and decreased social isolation. For care home personnel and activity co-ordinators the outcomes were: improved skills in caring for older people and increased confidence in using arts interventions. The analysis yielded an SROI of £1.20 for every £1 of expenditure. The sensitivity analysis revealed that when we consider a displacement rate of 15% for all the outcomes of all participating stakeholders, the Imagine study is unlikely to report a ratio that is less than £1.02 for every £1.00 invested.
Conclusions
Findings could inform policy decisions about investment in the arts and health or social care.",

abstract = "Background
Person-centred care is widely accepted in health policy as a central focus for health services. However, research studies indicate that, for nurses, the person-centred care of older people with cognitive impairment is challenging.
Aim
This study aimed to compare levels of person-centred care between wards and professional groups (ENs and RNs) providing tertiary hospital care of older people with cognitive impairment.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional survey design, using the 15-item Person-centredness of Older People with cognitive impairment in Acute Care (POPAC) survey instrument, was undertaken.
Results
Nurses working in hospital wards of a tertiary-level health service (n=240; RR=54.3%) responded. Person-centred care was rated lower in wards with higher patient turnover compared to wards with lower patient turnover. Person-centred care was rated higher by enrolled nurses compared to registered nurses.
Discussion
Hospital context, specifically high turnover wards, present a threat to person-centred care, possibly related to the limited time available to undertake the personal care and associated conversations that can enhance nurses’ knowledge of the person. ENs carry more responsibility for these tasks, possibly explaining the variability in person-centred scores between RNs and ENs. In comparison to other studies, nurses in this study had higher average scores for person-centred care, raising measurement as an important challenge in monitoring the implementation of person-centred care policy.
Conclusion
The focus on health service efficiency appears to pose a threat to nurses’ delivery of person-centred care. Further research into the variability between person-centred care of RNs and ENs, and investigation into the practices of other health disciplines would be valuable. Given the importance of person-centred care to the safety and quality of health services, the POPAC addresses the challenge of monitoring person-centred policy initiatives. However, self-report instruments should be balanced with other sources of information about practice.",

This study aims to determine the impact of grandchild care provision on elders’ mental health by self-comparison and longitudinal study design.
Method
Information of 2930 grandparents from the Study of Health and Living Status of the Middle-Aged and Elderly in Taiwan were analysed. Elders’ mental health was evaluated by Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale in both 2003 and 2007. Participants were divided into 4 groups based on their changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren from 2003 to 2007. Chi-square test was used to compare changes in elders’ individual characteristics and total CESD scores between and within groups. ANOVA was used to compare the means of elders’ depressive symptoms between groups while paired-t test was used to compare changes in elders’ depression symptoms from 2003 to 2007. Logistic regression was performed to determine the associations between elders' changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren and changes in depressive symptoms.
Results
Elders continuously caring for grandchildren or started to take care of grandchildren significantly felt happier and enjoyed life more than before and more than elders who do not provide grandchild care. Logistic regression analyses exploring the impact of grandchild care provision found that elders provided no grandchild care had worst mental health amongst all. Elders stopped providing grandchild care had significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms (OR=1.40) than elders provided no grandchild care at all time.
Discussion
By self-comparison, this study illustrates how taking care of grandchildren maintains elders’ mental health, especially against them from loneliness and depression.",

abstract = "Objective
The aim of this article was to synthesize research findings about health care providers’ experiences of patient-centered care in the home setting.
Methods
This is a meta-synthesis of qualitative findings using the analytical method of meta-ethnography developed by Noblit and Hare. We performed a systematic literature search in seven databases and assessed potential studies against eligibility criteria and quality. Subsequently, 10 primary studies were included for analysis.
Results
The core theme “being a balance artist” emerged from the synthesis, incorporating the participants’ experiences when faced with conflicting and competing responsibilities and needs. Two subthemes—“balancing the older clients’ needs against organizational demands” and “balancing the older clients’ needs against professional standards”—further elaborated on this core theme.
Conclusion
Health care providers’ experiences indicate that organizational factors play a crucial role in shaping the conditions for patient-centered care for older people in the home setting.
Practice implications
To motivate and facilitate health care providers to move to a more patient-centered practice, it is important to expand the values of patient-centered care beyond the clinical encounter into the organization.",

abstract = "Objective
Existing evidence on long-term psychotropic polypharmacy in older people is scarce despite serious safety concerns regarding this issue. This study aims to identify distinct trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use and to examine the association with the risk of mortality and unplanned hospitalization according to distinct trajectories.
Design
A retrospective longitudinal cohort study based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).
Setting and participants
A population-based study including 39,803 eligible participants aged 65 years or older who were newly prescribed oral psychotropic agents in 2004.
Measures
We assessed 5 years of monthly consumption of psychotropic agents among eligible participants and used group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct groups of longitudinal psychotropic use. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between distinct trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use and subsequent 1- and 3-year unplanned hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
Results
Among 39,803 eligible participants, we identified 5 trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use over a 5-year follow-up period: sustained intense (7.1%), moderate increasing (12.1%), decreasing (13.4%), slowly increasing (15.7%), and infrequent users (51.6%). Moderate increasing and sustained intense use were associated with significantly higher risks of unplanned hospitalization [moderate increasing use: hazard ratio [HR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.44; sustained intense use: HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.58] and all-cause mortality (moderate increasing use: HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.44; sustained intense use: HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12-1.56) than infrequent use. Similar results were observed at 3 years of follow-up.
Conclusions/Implications
Older people with moderately increasing and sustained intense use of psychotropic agents over time had higher risks of unplanned hospitalization and mortality. Tracking older people's use of psychotropic agents over time may help to identify individuals at greatest risk of unplanned hospitalization and mortality.",

We don´t know how positive emotions are being expressed by patients and health care providers in consultations. The aim of this study is to identify positive emotions expressed by older people and nurse assistants to discuss the function of these in the visits.
Method
This paper presents secondary analysis of consultations in the COMHOME project. In this pilot study, six transcribed consultations between nurse assistants and older people in home health care were analysed using a coding system for positive emotions with seven categories capturing both content and emotional intensity of positive affect.
Results
We found 114 expressions of positive emotions, 63% from nurse assistants and 37% from patients. Patients mostly expressed gratitude, indicating that patients are grateful for being helped. Nurse assistants mostly expressed Praise or Support, indicating that they gave their patients positive affirmation.
Conclusion
The praise and support given by nurse assistants to older people in home health care seemed effective in fostering relationships and maintaining patient resilience. Thus, we claim that emotional talk in communication also should include positive emotions.
Practice Implication
Teaching health care providers about the importance of expressions of positive emotions should be integrated in communication skills training.",

The burden of unrelieved pain experienced by older people and its associated high symptom and economic costs demands consideration of new strategies to better this condition. As the global uptake of digital technology increases, exploring its potential to impact positively on older peoples’ pain self-management practices warrants investigation. This integrative review aimed to evaluate the use of digital health technology for management of older people’s pain across care-settings. Searches were conducted to identify relevant English language studies published in CINHAL, Medline, Academic Search Complete, EMBASE, Cochrane library databases, and Google and Google Scholar websites. A total of 1003 papers were identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by three Phase II randomized controlled trials. These trials demonstrated the feasibility of computer based interactive or instructive video interventions however there was limited evidence to support their use for reduction of pain intensity and interference. Qualitative evidence demonstrated older people’s willingness to use mobile technologies (iPhone or digital pen) to help manage their pain, however, the need of device-use training and connectedness with clinicians were highlighted. In conclusion, there is some evidence that integrating digital health technology into older peoples’ pain self-management plan is feasible and acceptable. However, the provision of high-quality technological interventions informed by a thorough understanding of older people’s digital technology pain management needs is required to ensure greater integration of this technology in clinical practice.",

People being diagnosed of diabetes were more likely to be admitted to hospital than those without diabetes, although its effect dropped after controlling for clinical and functional complications. Largest asscociations were observed in women, people aged 50–65 years old, with medium educational level and medium household income. Diabetes was significant and positively related to mortality in the whole sample. Diabetes is significantly associated with mortality risk especially in males, oldest old people, low education and medium income people.

Despite increasing the efforts in increasing awareness about the benefits of PPE among the farm workers, a vast majority of the farm workers including pickers don't use the PPE. The present study examines health impacts of cotton harvesting in Pakistani Punjab along with the factors affecting the use of PPE among the cotton pickers. Cross-sectional data collected from Vehari district is used. The study estimates health cost and the use of PPE among the young and elder cotton pickers. Headache, sleeplessness, cough, flue/fever, skin and eyes problems are reported by the young and elder cotton pickers. Personal protective equipment is rarely used during picking. However, the young pickers relatively adopt more PPE compared to the elder cotton pickers. Health cost of cotton picking is US$2.96 and 3.06 per season during the year for the young and elder cotton pickers, respectively. Results of logit model show that health cost, age, education below 8th grade, perception of temporary impact and health problems are important determinants of adopting PPE among the cotton pickers. The findings of the study conclude that the use of PPE can be realized through proper training and education of cotton pickers and farm workers.",

Emergency department presentations by older people associated with mental health and drug and alcohol related conditions are increasing. However, the characteristics of presentations by older people in Australia are largely unknown. The aim of this research was to explore the characteristics of older people presenting with mental health and drug and alcohol conditions.
Procedures
We used a retrospective electronic medical record audit to explore all emergency department presentations by older people 65 years and over for mental health and drug and alcohol related conditions over a 12 month period. Data were described using descriptive statistics.
Finidngs
There were 40,093 presentations; 2% (n=900) were related to mental health or drug and alcohol related conditions. Presentations were mainly associated with primary mental or medical symptoms. The majority were female (n=471; 53%). Predominate conditions were cognitive impairment (n=234; 26%) and affective disorders (n=233; 26.0%). Sixty-three percent of patients were admitted to a hospital ward. Over the study period 106 patients (242 episodes of care) represented.
Principle conclusions
Given the ageing population and increasing prevalence for mental health and drug and alcohol conditions, strategies are required to better recognise these conditions to reduce the burden on the health care system and improve health for older people.",

To make medicines easier to swallow, many people will modify the medication dosage form e.g. split or crush tablets, and open capsules. Some of the challenges associated with administering medicines to older people, and issues with dosage form modification will be reviewed.

Falls are the most common cause of serious injuries and are a major health threat in the stratum of older population. Early detection of a fall is a key factor when trying to provide adequate care to elderly person who has suffered an accident at home. Therefore, the detection of falls in the elderly remains a major challenge in the field of public health. Specific actions aimed at the fall detection can provide urgent care which allows, on the other hand, drastically reduce the cost of medical care, and improve primary care service. In this paper, we present a support system for detecting falls of an elder person by the combination of a wearable wireless sensor node based on an accelerometer and a static wireless non-intrusive sensory infrastructure based on heterogeneous sensor nodes. This previous infrastructure called DIA (Dispositivo Inteligente de Alarma, in Spanish) is an AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) system that allows to infer a potential fall. This inference is reinforced for prompt attention by a specific sensorisation at portable node sensor in order to help distinguish between falls and daily activities of assisted person. The wearable node will not determine a falling situation, it will advice the reasoner layer about specific acceleration patterns that could, eventually, imply a falling. Is at the higher layer where the falling is determined from the whole context produced by mesh of fixed nodes. Experimental results have shown that the proposed system obtains high reliability and sensitivity in the detection of the fall.",

Medication adherence is a key factor of the therapy of chronic diseases in older people with chronic diseases. Inadequate health literacy results in poor health outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of health literacy on medication adherence to provide information for improving health outcomes in older people with chronic disease. This was a cross-sectional study of older people (people aged over 65 years) with chronic diseases in Korea taking one or more medications for 6 months and over from an academic referral medical center. Each patient completed a structured questionnaire by interview or self-report. Of the 291 older participants, 30.6% had high medication adherence. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis, health literacy was the strongest predictor of medication adherence (β=0.190, P=0.001). In addition, perceived health status, use of magnifying glass, and assistance with medication administration were also significant factors related to medication adherence. In conclusion, enhancing health literacy may improve medication adherence of older people with chronic disease. The development, implementation and evaluation of health literacy interventions for older people with chronic conditions are important to increase medication adherence and potentially improve patient outcomes. Such programs would also raise awareness of the impact of health literacy on patient outcomes. Furthermore, this could contribute to reducing health inequalities worldwide.",

The purpose of the study was to explore experiences of older people with cancer in ascertaining the attributes of a person-centred approach in sustaining hope and enabling human flourishing. This was a qualitative study comparing patients and professional experiences and perceptions of care across to ward settings.
Methods
Methods involved 10 semi-structured interviews conducted with patients and focus groups (n = 6) and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals. Three dissemination focus groups (n = 14) were also carried out with professionals to allow further analysis of the data.
Results
Two main themes were identified, including ‘Emotional adaptations of hope: wants and expectations’ and ‘Hope through belittling their illness’. Findings highlight the way hope is conveyed and the emphasis' accorded to issues such as societal perceptions, knowledge, expectations of care, life stage, relationships, identity, and emotions. Findings also reinforce the importance of maintaining hope, recognising the different ways hope is used, and enabling patients to flourish.
Conclusion
This study highlights how hope is facilitated through the interaction between patients and professionals and that the relational interactive stance. This current study establishes that hope seemed to be temporal, contextual and dynamic in nature, involving an ongoing process. Helping older people with cancer to understand their illness considering the situation of lives and experiences is essential to address expectations and wants.",

The number of older people is increasing rapidly and these demographical changes put a large stress on the health care system. Furthermore, as most older people wish to age-in-place, adequate ageing-in-place strategies become significantly important. Housing impacts health, therefore appropriate and comfortable housing is a key determinant to facilitate older people to age-in-place. One of the aspects of concern is thermal comfort; however, the thermal requirements of older people differ from those of young adults. They are also relatively vulnerable to thermal conditions outside the generally accepted range. This ’10 Questions' contribution addresses issues related to thermal comfort and ageing and argues that the current models for assessing thermal comfort are not sufficiently accurate to be used for older adults. It also discusses approaches to facilitate ageing-in-place including the use of smart home technologies. The paper is based on extensive literature review of numerous relevant studies relating to thermal comfort, physiological differences between older and younger people, the relationship between thermal environment, comfort and health, as well as housing design and smart home technologies for older people.",

While everyday travel – on foot, by public and community transport and by car – facilitated access to health-related goods and services (for example, food shops and health services), it is its broader contribution to quality of life in older age that our review highlights.",

abstract = "Background
Prevention of problematic alcohol use is mainly focused on younger adults, while heavy drinking in middle-aged and older adults might be more frequent with more impact on functioning and health care use. Therefore, alcohol use and alcohol disorder in both age groups was compared. To facilitate age-specific prevention, it was examined whether risk factors of heavy drinking and impact on functioning and health care use differs across the life-span.
Methods
Data of people (23–70 years) were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (N = 4618), a general population-based cohort. Heavy alcohol use was defined as >14 drinks/week for women and >21 drinks/week for men. Alcohol disorder was defined as DSM-IV disorder of alcohol abuse and/or alcohol dependence. (Multinomial) logistic regression analyses were used to study risk factors of alcohol use and associations between alcohol use and health care use and functioning.
Results
The past-year prevalence of heavy alcohol was higher in older (55–70 years) compared to younger people (6.7% versus 3.8%), whereas alcohol disorder was less prevalent (1.3% versus 3.9%). Heavy alcohol use was associated with higher level of education in older adults compared to younger adults. Other characteristics of problematic alcohol use and its impact on functioning and health care use did not differ between age groups.
Conclusions
Heavy drinking is more prevalent among middle-aged and older people. Contrary to younger adults, prevention of heavy alcohol use in those aged 55–70 should focus on higher educated people.",

This percentage is even lower (9.8%) in urban China. It is, therefore, important to understand the pathways by which physical activity behaviors are impacted by the built environment. This study utilized a mixed methods approach—interviews (n = 42) and longitudinal (2010–2015) health survey data (n = 3094) for older people residing in three neighborhoods in Huainan, a mid-sized city in Anhui Province, central eastern China. First, a content analysis of interview data was used to identify individual and built environment factors (motivators and barriers) that impacted physical activity within older people's activity spaces. Second, a multilevel path analysis was conducted using the health survey data to demonstrate the pathways by which these motivators and barriers contributed to the initiation, regulation, and maintenance of physical activity. This study found (a) that the liveliness of an apartment building and its proximity to functional spaces (fast-food stores, farmer's markets, supermarkets, pharmacies, schools, hospitals, PA facilities and natural and man-made water bodies) were important factors in attracting sedentary older people to initiate physical activity; (b) the social networks of apartment neighbors helped to initiate, regulate, and maintain physical activity; and housing closeness to functional spaces was important in maintaining physical activity, particularly for those older people with chronic diseases. To increase older people's overall physical activity, future interventions should focus on residential form and access to functional spaces, prior to investing in large-scale urban design interventions.",

These have important implications for social protection systems. The goal of this paper is to model future functional disability and healthcare expenditures based on current trends. To project the health, disability and hospitalization spending of future elders, we adapted the Future Elderly Model (FEM) to Singapore. The FEM is a dynamic Markov microsimulation model developed in the US. Our main source of population data was the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) consisting of 63,000 respondents followed up over three waves from 1993 to 2010. The FEM model enables us to investigate the effects of disability compounded over the lifecycle and hospitalization spending, while adjusting for competing risk of multi-comorbidities. Results indicate that by 2050, 1 in 6 elders in Singapore will have at least one ADL disability and 1 in 3 elders will have at least one IADL disability, an increase from 1 in 12 elders and 1 in 5 elders respectively in 2014. The highest prevalence of functional disability will be in those aged 85 years and above. Lifetime hospitalization spending of elders aged 55 and above is US$24,400 (30.2%) higher among people with functional disability compared to those without disability. Policies that successfully tackle diabetes and promote healthy living may reduce or delay the onset of disability, leading to potential saving. In addition, further technological improvements may reduce the financial burden of disability.",

Background
Taiwan is an aging society by the definition of the World Health Organization. The trend of elder population is one of the fastest worldwide. The Taiwan Foundation for Geriatric Emergency and Critical Care dedicates to disseminate health promotion behaviors for community elders and middle age adults. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and satisfaction of the health education programs on health promotion behaviors.
Methods
A one-group pretest-posttest study was conducted using purposively sampling of participants of the health education programs at five community care centers in the great Taipei metropolitan area. A structure questionnaire was developed to collect data. SPSS 20.0 was used in statistical analysis.
Results
Above 40% of 136 participants were either overweight or obesity. Comparing pretest and posttest scores, the changes in mentality, perceived health, physical exercise, and blood pressure measurement were significant (p < 0.05). The overall satisfaction with the health education programs was high (3.62). It was found the correlation between marital status and perceived health was positive (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
The health education programs specifically for elders and middle age adults in community care centers were effective in raising the awareness of health promotion behaviors. The success could provide a reference for future studies developing health promotion and education programs and holistic care for community elders and middle age adults in Taiwan.",

Alzheimer disease (AD) can affect masticatory function, affecting oral health–related quality of life (OHRQoL). Whether oral rehabilitation with conventional removable prostheses can restore masticatory function and improve OHRQoL in these individuals is unknown.
Purpose
The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the influence of oral rehabilitation with removable prostheses on masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL in elders with and without AD.
Material and methods
Thirty-two elders with mild AD (n=16, mean age=76.7 ±6.3 years) or without AD (n=16, mean age=75.2 ±4.4 years) were recruited. All participants first underwent masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL evaluations, and 2 months after insertion of new removable prostheses, the variables were reassessed. Masticatory efficiency was determined using the sieving method, and OHRQoL was measured by applying the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). The data from the baseline and after insertion of the new removable prostheses were compared by paired t test. Group differences at each time point were assessed by t test (α=.05).
Results
After insertion of the new removable prostheses, masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL improved in both the elders with AD and the control. At baseline, elders with AD had lower masticatory efficiency and higher OHRQoL than controls (P<.05). After removable prosthesis insertion, elders with AD continued to show lower masticatory efficiency values than controls, but their OHRQoL was similar.
Conclusions
Oral rehabilitation with new removable prostheses improved the masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL of elders with and without AD, although masticatory efficiency did not reach control levels in elders with AD.",

abstract = "Purpose
The prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among older people is high. Screening for CRC presents a cost-effective secondary prevention and control strategy which results in a significant reduction in mortality. This study aims to describe the prevalence of CRC screening and examine its risk factors among Chinese community-dwelling older people guided by a comprehensive model combining Health Belief Model and Extended Parallel Processing Model.
Methods
A descriptive correlational study was conducted. A convenience sample of 240 community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 was recruited in May–July in 2012 in Hong Kong. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire which collected information on demographic variables, CRC-related psychosocial variables and whether they had a CRC screening in the past 10 years.
Results
Among the participants, 25.4% reported having a CRC screening test. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that participants with a higher level in cue to action, and lower perceived knowledge barriers and severity-fear were significantly associated with participation in CRC screening. But there were no significant associations between fatalism and cancer fear with screening.
Conclusions
The prevalence of CRC screening was low in Hong Kong Chinese community-dwelling elders. A number of modifiable factors associated with CRC screening were identified which provides specific targets for interventions. This study also adds to the knowledge regarding the associations between fatalism and fear with CRC screening behaviors among Chinese older people.",

abstract = "Background
An intervention ‘Better Oral Health in Home Care’ was introduced (2012–2014) to improve the oral health of older people receiving community aged care services. Implementation of the intervention was theoretically framed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Process outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in older people’s oral health.
Objective
To evaluate the extent to which the intervention has been embedded and sustained into routine community aged care practice 3 years after the initial implementation project.
Design
A Realist Evaluation applying Normalisation Process Theory within a single case study setting.
Setting
Community aged care (home care) provider in South Australia, Australia.
Participants
Purposeful sampling was undertaken. Twelve staff members were recruited from corporate, management and direct care positions. Two consumers representing high and low care recipients also participated.
Methods
Qualitative methods were applied in two subcases, reflecting different contextual settings. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and analysed deductively by applying the Normalisation Process Theory core constructs (with the recommended phases of the Realist Evaluation cycle). Retrospective and prospective analytic methods investigated how the intervention has been operationalised by comparing two timeframes: Time 1 (Implementation June 2012–December 2014) and Time 2 (Post-implementation July 2017–July 2018).
Results
At Time 1, the initial program theory proposed that multi-level facilitation contributed to a favourable context that triggered positive mechanisms supportive of building organisational and workforce oral healthcare capacity. At Time 2, an alternative program theory of how the intervention has unfolded in practice described a changed context following the withdrawal of the project facilitation processes with the triggering of alternative mechanisms that have made it difficult for staff to embed sustainable practice.
Conclusion
Findings concur with the literature that successful implementation outcomes do not necessarily guarantee sustainability. The study has provided a deeper explanation of how contextual characteristics have contributed to the conceptualisation of oral healthcare as a low priority, basic work-ready personal care task and how this, in turn, hindered the embedding of sustainable oral healthcare into routine community aged care practice. This understanding can be used to better inform the development of strategies, such as multi-level facilitation, needed to navigate contextual barriers so that sustainable practice can be achieved.",

Parkinson disease (PD) symptoms, such as muscle rigidity, tremors in the lips and tongue, and involuntary mandibular movements, may cause oral health-related problems, mastication difficulties, and denture discomfort because of the difficulty in controlling a prosthesis with the oral musculature.
Purpose
The purpose of this observational clinical study was to evaluate the influence of oral rehabilitation with a removable prosthesis on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and masticatory efficiency (ME) in elders with PD.
Material and methods
Thirty-four elders with PD (n=17, mean age 69.4 ±4.7 years) or without PD (n=17, mean age 70.7 ±4.7 years) were recruited. All participants first underwent OHRQoL and ME evaluations. Two months after the insertion of new removable prostheses, the participants were reassessed. The OHRQoL was measured with the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-49). ME was evaluated by determining the percentage weight of the comminuted silicone-based artificial material that passed through a 2.8 mm sieve. For each group, data were compared between baseline and after insertion of new removable prostheses by paired t test or Wilcoxon sign test/signed-rank test. Group differences were assessed at each time point by t test (α=.05).
Results
After the insertion of removable prostheses, elders with PD showed improved OHRQoL and ME. Controls also showed improvements on both measures after insertion of removable prostheses. At baseline, elders with PD had lower OHRQoL and ME compared with the controls (P<.05). After removable prosthesis insertion, the elders with PD continued to show lower ME values than the controls, but their OHRQoL was similar.
Conclusions
Oral rehabilitation with new removable dental prostheses improved the OHRQoL and ME in elders with and without PD, although ME did not reach control levels in elders with PD.",

Empty nest has been becoming the main family pattern among old people, and influencing the traditional family providing for the aged in China. This study aimed to investigate the association of empty nest with depressive symptom in a Chinese elderly population.
Methods
Our study was based on the baseline investigation of Zhejiang Major Public Health Surveillance which was conducted in 2014. The final analyzed sample consisted of 9215 participants aged no less than 60 years. Subjects completed a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, living arrangements, behavioral risk factors, health status, subjective assessments, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale.
Results
More than half of the participants were empty nest elders (57.4%). The overall prevalence of depressive symptom was 10.3%, while it was higher in empty nest group than in non-empty nest group (11.6% vs. 8.6%, P<0.001). A positive association was found between empty nest and depressive symptom, the OR (95%CI) was 1.223(1.045, 1.431). After stratified by gender/age/education level/employment status, this association was just prominent in participants of male, 70 years old and above, primary school education, and retirees. No matter living with spouse or living alone, empty nesters were more likely to have depressive symptoms than non-empty nesters.
Limitations
Cross-sectional study could not make a causation conclusion. The social supports of participants were not been investigated in detail.
Conclusions
Empty nest elders, especially those who are male, 70 years old and above, primary school education, and retired, are more vulnerable to depressive symptom.",

In one depopulated town (Ikeda, Nakagawa-gun, Hokkaido, Japan), volunteer residents have held Net Step Exercise classes throughout the town since 2007. We longitudinally examined the influence of volunteer-led Net Step Exercise class participation on subsequent self-rated health in all individuals aged 70–79 years living in Ikeda. A total of 662 people who completed a baseline mail-in questionnaire survey in 2012 were followed until 2014. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association with self-rated health after two years of class participation once a month or more at baseline, after controlling for confounds such as age, sex, years of education, living alone, baseline self-rated health, regular exercise, and other physical activities. The odds ratio of poor self-rated health in older people who participated in classes was 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.85) compared to older people not participating in classes. Even after confounding factors were adjusted, the odds ratio of class participation was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29–0.85).

When a disaster occurs older people are recognised to be among one of the vulnerable population groups. During the Great East Japan earthquake in 2011, there were numerous unresolved health and social issues for the survivors.
Aim of the study
To understand which challenges older people that survived the 2011 disaster faced, which aspects they identified as concerns and what they felt was difficult and possibly could not recover from in the near future.
Methods
A qualitative case study method was used. Sixteen participants, living in temporary housing, were interviewed in 2015. The interview data was analysed using thematic analysis.
Findings and discussion
Participants (4 men; 12 women) were aged between 65 and 89 years. Seven participants stated that they were healthy although they had minor health issues. Some women had psycho-social health issues brought about by the trauma they experienced, caring for their aging relatives and living in temporary housing. Four themes emerged: feeling grateful to be alive; issues related to health and mental health; the importance of recreational activities and community involvement; feeling of fear, uncertainty and vulnerability.
Conclusions
This is the first study to report directly participants’ feelings and views after their traumatic experience. All participants were happy to be interviewed and to express their views. Although participants expressed their need for health professional services to be available to support them following traumatic events, these services are yet to be recognised as an essential part of the recovery process.",

However, elders’ privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication. To show that elders’ privacy could be substantially exposed, in this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders’ movement activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS in deducing and disclosing elders’ privacy, which might be maliciously exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.",

abstract = "Background
Steadily increasing numbers of older people and people in need of care represent critical challenges for today’s society. In the last years, diverse (health-related) technologies have been developed to facilitate living at home for older people but also to support (professional) care personnel in their daily care efforts. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have the potential to enhance safety, support medical therapy, or facilitate everyday chores and social life. With the huge range and variety of technical opportunities, the question arises what influences (potential) users’ decisions for the right technology in their individual conditions and situations. In particular with regard to the fragility of the care situation, it is unknown which technologies are desired for different care needs and diverse situations.
Objectives
The present study investigates (1) personal care needs as a potential influencing parameter for technology acceptance and (2) the selection of specific technologies.
Method
In an online questionnaire (including n = 162 people of all ages), technology acceptance and the selection of specific technologies was assessed, using two scenarios differing in their personal care needs (low care needs vs. moderate care needs) in two situational contexts (emergency detection vs. medical reminders).
Results
Personal care needs influence the perception of benefits, barriers, and general acceptance of assisting technologies, independent from situational context. Higher needs for care lead to higher acknowledgements of the technology’s benefits, lower agreements or, in parts, higher rejections of potential barriers and higher acceptance. The two care situations differ regarding the participants’ preferences for technologies: For emergency detection, smart watches and emergency buttons are clearly accepted. In contrast, cameras are consistently rejected. For situations in which medical reminders are used, smartphone and smartwatches are most wanted, whereas audio assistants and smart TV were rather rejected.
Conclusions
The results provide insights into users’ preferences for specific technologies for the purpose of emergency detection and medical reminders as well as for the important influence of personal care needs. These insights can be used to derive user-tailored solutions of technology configurations for specific care needs and situations.",

abstract = "Providing support for ageing and frail populations to extend their personal autonomy is desirable for their well-being as it is for the society at large, since it can ease the economic and social challenges caused by ever-ageing developed societies. Ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies and services might be a solution to address those challenges. Recent improved capabilities in both ambient and wearable technologies, especially those related with video and lifelogging data, and huge advances in the accuracy of intelligent systems for AAL are leading to more valuable and trustworthy services for older people and their caregivers. These advances have been particularly relevant in the last years due to the appearance of RGB-D devices and the development of deep learning systems. This article reviews these latest developments in the intersection of AAL, intelligent systems, lifelogging, and computer vision. This paper provides a study of previous reviews in these fields, and later analyses newer intelligent techniques employed with different video-based lifelogging technologies in order to offer lifelogging services for AAL. Additionally, privacy and ethical issues associated with these technologies are discussed. This review aims at facilitating the understanding of the multiple fields involved.",

abstract = "Statistics show that a bathroom is one of the most hazardous places especially for older people. Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed. Authors propose 1) sensor selection and application, 2) integration of a wireless sensor local network system, 3) design concept for IoT implementation, and 4) a big data analysis system model in this paper.",

We combine these three approaches with an ethnographical analysis to achieve a deeper understanding of several difficulties with pTD that are typical in the realization within the AAL field, especially when a mediating method, such as SBD, is adopted. In this respect the theoretical contribution consists of outlining the importance of a strictly bottom-up view on pTD. Finally, we conclude with two general recommendations on how the inclusion of care workers and older people as target groups of pTD within the AAL field can be accomplished more successfully.",

The need to support these elderly, in difficulty has prompted researchers to focus on the field of home care. Several platforms have been developed over the last two decades, based on several functionalities to the improvement of their quality. Hence, Quality Criteria (QCs) must be identified and well defined to successfully achieve the system purposes. The goal is to obtain a set of data quality characteristics that would be applicable to the context of AAL systems and evaluate them using data coming from multiple sensors. To do this, we based our work on ISO/IEC 25012 and ISO/IEC 25010 standards that establish QCs respectively on system and software product quality and data quality, to extract the most relevant QCs that could be more fitting for AAL systems. We have applied an approach to extract the most important criteria than can be associated with AAL system based on the acquisition, the transmission, and the treatment processes. To convince all stakeholders including both technologies and end users of AAL systems, high quality must be guaranteed, but measuring quality in AAL system is difficult because of the variety of stakeholders. To evaluate the entire data quality model for AAL system, we will apply an evaluation procedure on this model, which consists first make our model hierarchically, then evaluate it using the metrics based on the sensor data and the concept of fuzzy logic.",

abstract = "Background and objectives
Compared with other European countries, older people in Romania experience high rates of poverty and disability. In this, the first study to investigate wellbeing in older Romanian people attending public and third sector day facilities, we tested our hypotheses, based on a successful aging model, that greater wellbeing would be associated with a healthier lifestyle (lower levels of alcohol consumption and smoking), better physical health, mental health, social support (less loneliness) and absence of abuse.
Methods
Older people (65+) without significant cognitive impairment, recruited from three Bucharest social care centers, completed structured questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5).
Results
100/140 (71%) eligible potential participants approached participated; mean WHO-5 score was 67.7 (standard deviation=20.7); 25 (25%) scored <50, indicating low wellbeing. In our final model, lower depression (β=−0.40, t=−3.8, p<0.001) and loneliness scores (β=−0.22, t=−2.1, p=0.034) predicted higher wellbeing. More physical health problems and hospitalisations were associated with lower wellbeing on univariate analyses, but not in the final model. Screening positive for abuse (23 (23%) of participants), activities of daily living, alcohol and smoking status did not predict wellbeing.
Conclusions
Despite experiencing high rates of loneliness, depression, anxiety and abuse, this population of older, Romanian people receiving social support, reported wellbeing levels comparable to European working populations. Loneliness was a more important predictor of lower wellbeing than any other factors studied. Tailored interventions to reduce loneliness in Romanian older people receiving community social support would be a rational next step.",

For this purpose, a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN device wearable is used, which is responsible for collecting data from movements of elderly people in real-time. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, the sensor readings are processed and analyzed using a decision trees-based Big Data model running on a Smart IoT Gateway. If a fall is detected, an alert is activated and the system reacts automatically by sending notifications to the groups responsible for the care of the elderly people. Finally, the system provides services built on cloud. From medical perspective, there is a storage service that enables healthcare professional to access to falls data for perform further analysis. On the other hand, the system provides a service leveraging this data to create a new machine learning model each time a fall is detected. The results of experiments have shown high success rates in fall detection in terms of accuracy, precision and gain.",

Method
This study using a qualitative phenomenological method, via in-depth interviews, in which the saturation point was reached at the ten participants. The ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, maleficence, and justice were applied.
Results
This study identified two main topics: first, family ability to perform family health tasks and second, the different types of family cultures that influence taking care of the health of older people, which were reflected through several sub-topics, namely, pampering the parents, doing everything they asked, and controlling all their activities. The habits of pampering and assenting to the wishes of older people with diabetes are highly risky, as, when they are food-related, they can increase blood glucose.
Conclusion
The findings of this study reveal that the family habits which highly risky to increase blood glucose older people must be changed through negotiation efforts and cultural restructuring, such that the treatments provided are in accordance with the diabetes management pattern. The results of the present study are useful in improving health services for older people with diabetes in the multicultural country of Indonesia.",

However, the current state of development is still mostly oriented to a technological perspective, where the individual's functionality has not been fully addressed. Under the Living Usability Lab project we have defined a methodology and created some evaluation tools for assessment of AAL services according to a Living Lab perspective, based on the ICF. In this paper we intend to describe the base fundamentals of this proposal, as well as present some results concerning a practical implementation of this methodology.",

In particular, we propose an algorithm based on a heuristic and machine learning to detect ‘long-lie’ situations. The proposed algorithm minimizes the effects of noise present in the RFID information by relying on eight features extracted using only binary tag observation information from a possible location of a fall on the smart carpet. By evaluating the proposed approach with broadly scripted activities, which included a complex set of walking patterns, we show that the proposed algorithm depicts a good overall performance of 93% F-score.",

Productive activities included working and/or taking care of any (great)grandchild(ren) in the past 12 months prior to the survey. Using paired t-tests and probit models, we compared the differences in these productive activities among older people in terms of sex and living area. The results from various t-tests showed that educational attainment, health status and poverty status were key factors differentiating older men and women and rural and urban older people in these productive activities. For the probit estimations in terms of both gender and living location, the results indicated that age, education, health status and supportive children were determinants of working decision, while age, marital status and size of household were consistently important factors of taking care of (great)grandchildren. The paper also discussed policy implications for socio-economic and health protection in promoting older people's productive activities as well as protecting them from a variety of risks and vulnerabilities.",

It is well established that social exclusion is a key social determinant of health; however, such association between social exclusion and health outcomes among older people remain a relatively under-researched area. This paper explores the effects of four dimensions of social exclusion on self-rated health and depression among older people in China.
Methods
This paper includes 8038 individuals aged 60 and over from the first wave national multi-stage probability sample (2014) from the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS). Descriptive univariate information for individual variables and four dimensions of social exclusion are presented. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models are used to examine the associations between social exclusion and self-rated health and depression.
Results
Older people who were in the lower level of exclusion from social relationships or subjective feelings of exclusion were significantly less likely to report fair or poor self-rated health than people in the higher level of exclusion (lower level of exclusion from social activities was significantly associated with being less likely to report poor SRH only). Older people who were in the lower level of subjective feeling of exclusion or exclusion from financial products were significantly less likely to report depression.
Conclusions
Different dimensions of social exclusion have different effects on self-rated health and depression. Social policies need to reflect this and efforts of services could usefully be oriented to prevent multi-dimensions of social exclusion. Ultimately, such policies should have the potential to enhance the health of older people in China.",

abstract = "Background
Falls in older people is a global public health concern. Physical exercise is a useful and potentially cost-saving treatment option to prevent falls in older people.
Objectives
We aimed to (1) summarize the research literature regarding the cost-effectiveness of exercise-based programs for falls prevention in older people and (2) discuss the implications of the review's findings for clinical practice and future research on the dosage of cost-effective exercise-based falls prevention programs for older people.
Methods
Multiple databases were searched from inception until February 2019. Studies were included if they (1) were randomized controlled trials with an economic evaluation of exercise-based falls prevention programs for people ≥ 60 years old and (2) assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost per quality-adjusted life year, incremental cost per fall and benefit-to-cost ratio of programs. Methodological quality was assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and quality of economic evaluation with the Quality of Health Economic Studies.
Results
We included 12 studies (3668 older people). Interventions for falls prevention were either exercise-only or multifactorial programs. Five studies of high economic quality and 2 of high methodological quality provided evidence supporting exercise-only programs as cost-effective for preventing falls in older people. Specifically, a tailored exercise program including strengthening of lower extremities, balance training, cardiovascular exercise, stretching and functional training of moderate intensity performed twice per week with each session lasting 60min for ≥ 6 months delivered in groups of 3 to 8 participants with home-based follow-up appears to be cost-effective in preventing falls in older people.
Conclusion
There is evidence to support exercise-based interventions as cost-effective treatment for preventing falls. Further research is needed to fully establish the cost-effectiveness of such programs, especially in both developing and underdeveloped countries.

Elder abuse (abuse/violence/neglect or disrespect as defined by BKPAI data) among elderly is a deserted and overlooked issue especially in developing countries including India.
Aim
To assess the elder abuse and its association with socio-demographic factors among elderly population.
Materials and Methods
This study comprises data from BKPAI 2011. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis have been used for the following study.
Results
A total of 9852 elderly people were included in this study which was carried out in seven states of India. The mean age of the study subjects was 68.04±7.29 years. Among 9852 elderly people 10% (987) were faced elder abuse. In unadjusted odd-ratio the status of elder abuse was found statistically significant with state, type of residence, sex, age group, caste, education, marital status, migration status, occupation, health condition and economic dependency etc. But in binary logistic regression analysis state, type of residence, sex, education, caste and their migration status were found statistically significant with elder abuse.
Conclusion
From the result of this study, the existence of “violence”, “neglect”, and “disrespect” within the society and community is approved. The problems of abuse among older persons were more mental than physical and elderly at getting older, without partner, with bad health condition, having less money or with no security are on more risk of getting abused.",

abstract = "In recent years several world-wide ambient assisted living (AAL) programs have been activated in order to improve the quality of life of older people, and to strengthen the industrial base through the use of information and communication technologies. An important issue is extending the time that older people can live in their home environment, by increasing their autonomy and helping them to carry out activities of daily livings (ADLs). Research in the automatic detection of falls has received a lot of attention, with the object of enhancing safety, emergency response and independence of the elderly, at the same time comparing the social and economic costs related to fall accidents. In this work, an algorithmic framework to detect falls by using a 3D time-of-flight vision technology is presented. The proposed system presented complementary working requirements with respect to traditional worn and non-worn fall-detection devices. The vision system used a state-of-the-art 3D range camera for elderly movement measurement and detection of critical events, such as falls. The depth images provided by the active sensor allowed reliable segmentation and tracking of elderly movements, by using well-established imaging methods. Moreover, the range camera provided 3D metric information in all illumination conditions (even night vision), allowing the overcoming of some typical limitations of passive vision (shadows, camouflage, occlusions, brightness fluctuations, perspective ambiguity). A self-calibration algorithm guarantees different setup mountings of the range camera by non-technical users. A large dataset of simulated fall events and ADLs in real dwellings was collected and the proposed fall-detection system demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity.",

The field study dataset was collected from 1040 old subjects (70 + years) who lived in 19 aged-care homes, which contains multi-dimension factors such as environmental parameters, subjects' demographic information, health condition, acclimatization degrees, living habits and thermal perceptions' votes. The lab study dataset was collected from a lab study and contains 18 old subjects' (65 + years) eight local skin temperatures and thermal perceptions' votes under five thermal environments (21/23/26/29/32 °C). After the procedure of feature selection, the field study model was developed with four environmental variables (air temperature, velocity, CO2 concentration, illuminance) plus two human-related variables (health condition and living time in aged-care homes) as inputs. It produced an overall accuracy of 56.6%, which was 24.9% higher than that of the PMV model. The lab study model was built on five local skin temperatures including head, lower arm, upper leg, chest and back temperatures, which demonstrated an overall accuracy of 76.7%, 30.1% higher than UC Berkeley thermal sensation model's accuracy. We then interpreted how these inputs distinguish thermal sensations by applying a partial dependence analysis.

This study aimed to describe work and activities of community networks focusing on the improvement of the quality of life (QOL) of older people in Thailand. The understanding of the work can help enhancing the community development and strengthening of local communities and their networks.
Methods
Qualitative methods including in-depth interview, observation, and focus group discussion were employed to the study. 64 participants participated to the study and were recruited from 4 key actors within the community. Content analysis was used to analyze the obtained data. This study was conducted in 6 local administrative organizations (LAOs) which selected from the outstanding areas of the project. Each LAO represents one sub-district of the regions of Thailand namely; (1) the upper north, (2) the lower north, (3)the upper eastern, (4) the lower eastern, (5) the central and (6) the south.
Results
The findings of this study were categorized into three main themes: (1) Social capital including people in the community, social groups, and organizations, (2) Mutual help/collaboration activities composed of six sets of activities related to social capitals working on the improvement of QOL of older people, and (3) Impacts of the mutual help/collaboration activities on older people and local communities who help to improve of QOL of older people.
Conclusion
The findings are important features for the community development. These themes should be recommended for community nurses, health related groups and organizations for the improvement of QOL of older people in the community.",

abstract = "Background
In the past century, elder abuse has become an important health issue and a stressful event that negatively affects the physical and mental health of the elders.
Aims
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of elder abuse in Iran through systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
All articles about elderly abuse in Iran since 2005–2017 were searched using the Google Scholar search engine, four Iranian databases (Magiran, IranMedex, SID) and six international English language databases(Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Pubmed, Science Direct-Embase) with keywords of Elder Abuse, Elder Mistreatment, Elder Neglect, Abuse and a combination of these keywords. After examining the entry and exit criteria and qualitative evaluation of the articles, Data was analyzed by comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software.
Findings
In a systematic review, 15 articles on elders in Iran were included in the study. The overall prevalence of elder abuse was 48.3% (with 95% confidence interval: 28.6–68.6) and the highest prevalence of elder abuse was related to the care neglect dimensionat the prevalence rate of 38.4% (with 95% confidence interval: 21.7–51.6) and the lowest prevalence rate of elder abuse was related to the rejection atthe prevalence rate of 11% (with 95% confidence interval: 6.9–17.1).
Conclusion
The prevalence of elder abuse among elders was high in Iran. Considering the growing elderly population in Iran, preventive measures should be considered in this regard. For this reason, community health nurses are required to provide the elderly, family and community with necessary preventive interventions in this regard.",

During the last decades scientific literature has focused on the positive relationships between Nature - Based Activities (NBA) and health. The aging of the population and the increasing costs of health services make it important to investigate the benefits for older people.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to systematically review the existing literature regarding Nature – Based Activities addressed to older people.
Methods
A systematic search of the literature was made in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus from 2005 till December 2018.
Results
We identified 42 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The results highlighted the multidisciplinary use of nature in many settings as well as a variety of different research designs, both quantitative and qualitative. The majority of experimental assessments were carried out in the setting of nursing homes and residential facilities. A variety of treatments, e.g. horticultural therapy, gardening, green visiting, green exercise and of settings, e.g. residential facilities or adult day services, participants’ homes, outdoor settings, and green care farms were examined.
Conclusions
The examined studies offered numerous examples of the healing power of nature for the health and well-being of older people. Occupational therapists could gain substantial insight from earlier experiences of NBA for application in their practices.",

The number of Seniors Councils in Poland has grown in recent years thanks to favorable legislative changes in 2013 and 2015. Since 2015, the local executive administration is obliged to establish a Seniors Council if there is local demand for such a council. The influence of senior councils is likely to grow over the coming years, given the ageing of the population and the related increasing importance of older citizens in the electorate, especially for local political leaders. Seniors Councils can support better informed local decision-making by helping to identify local needs and contributing to a better allocation of scarce resources. They may also help to draw more resources to health promotion and primary prevention for older people in an environment of financial constraints and a health care system that traditionally prioritizes curative care.",

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for periodontitis for over 40 years and novel evidence suggests that periodontitis has an impact on glycemic control in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to compare oral health complications in diabetic older patients from Brazil and France.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 120 patients aged 65 and over diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Sixty patients were admitted to a center for diabetes and hypertension care in Brazil and 60 patients were admitted to the Rouen University hospital. Dental conditions were assessed through the decayed, missing and filled teeth index and periodontal condition was assessed using the Community Periodontal Index. The significance threshold was p < 0.05.
Results
Decayed teeth differed statistically between the groups (p = 0.001). The French group presented more tooth mobility, gingival recession and furcation involvement (p < 0.001). Tooth brushing frequency differed significantly between the groups (p < 0.030). The main cause of missing teeth was periodontitis in the French group and caries and periodontitis in the Brazilian group (p < 0.001). Statistical significance was found for use of fixed upper (p = 0.013) and lower (p = 0.013) dentures in the French group. The French group needed upper denture rehabilitation (p = 0.010) while the Brazilian group needed lower denture rehabilitation (p = 0.003).
Conclusion
Edentulism was prevalent in diabetic older people in both countries. However, the French participants presented with better oral health.",

abstract = "Although the population of older people in Africa is increasing, and older people are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to urbanisation, breakdown of family structures and rising healthcare costs, most African countries have no social health protection for older people. Two exceptions include Senegal's Plan Sesame, a user fees exemption for older people and Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) where older people are exempt from paying premiums. Evidence on whether older people are aware of and enrolling in these schemes is however lacking. We aim to fill this gap. Besides exploring economic indicators, we also investigate whether social exclusion determines enrolment of older people. This is the first study that tries to explore the social, political, economic and cultural (SPEC) dimensions of social exclusion in the context of social health protection programs for older people. Data were collected by two cross-sectional household surveys conducted in Ghana and Senegal in 2012. We develop SPEC indices and conduct logistic regressions to study the determinants of enrolment. Our results indicate that older people vulnerable to social exclusion in all SPEC dimensions are less likely to enrol in Plan Sesame and those that are vulnerable in the political dimension are less likely to enrol in NHIS. Efforts should be taken to specifically enrol older people in rural areas, ethnic minorities, women and those isolated due to a lack of social support. Consideration should also be paid to modify scheme features such as eliminating the registration fee for older people in NHIS and creating administration offices for ID cards in remote communities in Senegal.",

Polypharmacy is associated with inappropriate medication use, and subsequently increasing older persons’ risk of drug-related harm and health-related costs to individuals and society.
Objective
To examine and describe, using a national sample of patient-level medication data, the prevalence of older people's polypharmacy and medication use across dependency levels. To examine oral and general pain prevalence and associated analgesic usage.
Methods
Medication data from the 2012 New Zealand Older People's Oral Health Survey, a nationally-representative, cross-sectional study of dependent older people's oral health, were analysed descriptively, comparing classes and sub-classes of drugs and nutrient supplements taken across four categories of dependency: very low (own homes receiving in-home support), low, high and psychogeriatric (all receiving aged residential care). Self-reported current general pain and frequency of orofacial pain data were cross-tabulated by sub-classes of analgesics taken.
Results
All participants were taking at least one medication overall, 53.2% (95% CI: 50.4, 56.0) took between five and nine (polypharmacy), and 13.9% (95% CI: 17.4, 22.5) took 10 or more (hyperpolypharmacy). Antihypertensives, analgesics, antiulcer drugs, aspirin, laxatives, statins and antidepressants were the most common drug classes taken, the proportions differing between psychogeriatric level care and all other dependency groups. Overall, simple analgesics were taken (34.5%; 95%CI: 30.8, 38.4) more commonly than other analgesics; the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was low (3.6%; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.7). Of those reporting experiencing extreme general bodily pain, 63.3% (95% CI: 56.6, 69.4) took an analgesic, more than those experiencing mouth pain occasionally or often. Fat-soluble vitamins were the most common vitamin supplement taken (32.0%; 95%CI: 27.0, 37.4).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy are common among older people, regardless of dependency level, and pain may be undertreated.",

The aim of the study was to investigate HRQOL and its associated factors among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district, Sri Lanka.
Method
This cross-sectional survey involved 1300 older people. The Euro 5D-3L, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, body mass index, handgrip strength were used to measure HRQOL, physical activity and nutritional status of older people respectively. Factors associated with health-related quality of life were identified through complex sample logistic regression analysis.
Results
Majority of older people (81.9%) reported poor health-related quality of life. Middle old (aOR: 12.06, 95% CI: 5.76, 25.23), very old (aOR: 174.74, 95% CI: 39.74, 768.38), vegetarian diets (aOR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.96), under-nutrition (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.65, 7.04) and over-nutrition (aOR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.28) were significantly associated with poor HRQOL. Using dentures (aOR: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.90) was found as a protective factor for poor HRQOL.
Conclusions
HRQOL was poor among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district. Nutrition-related factors need to be further investigated to improve HRQOL among older people.",

We assessed the impact of the level of cognitive functioning on preference and scale heterogeneity in a discrete choice experiment undertaken with 126 older people living in residential aged care homes in Australia between January 2015 and February 2016. Data was analysed using conditional logit models for sub-groups of participants with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (N = 52) and without cognitive impairment (N = 74), and for the entire study sample using a heteroscedastic conditional logit regression model allowing for scale heterogeneity. The Swait-Louviere test was undertaken to formally test for differences in preference and scale between the two groups. Cognitive impairment was not significant in the scale function of the heteroscedastic conditional logit model (beta = −0.403, SE 0.341 p = 0.237). There were no statistical differences in estimated vector of preference parameters based on the presence or absence of cognitive impairment (Chi-squared = 13, 25 df, p = 0.976). Although there was evidence of a small increase in response variability with increasing cognitive impairment this did not reach statistical significance, and we were able to combine responses for people with and without cognitive impairment. Overall, the findings provide support for the more widespread inclusion of older people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment in such studies.",

Elder abuse in recent times has reached a remarkable international importance. This complex phenomenon is still little understood and studied in Italy. The aim of this study was to explore Italian healthcare professionals’ attitude and barriers toward elder abuse, with a glimpse on the current scenario and evidences to develop an action plan.
Materials and methods
42 healthcare professionals filled a questionnaire with 13 open-ended questions, analyzed with a qualitative content analysis. Data were grouped under the following 4 core-themes: description of elder abuse, abuse detection and perception, barriers to reporting, and professional orientation and approach; then they were analyzed to find their central component and discussed jointly.
Results
The respondents described physical (64%) and psychological (50%) abuse and neglect (50%) as the three main characteristics of elder abuse; the 59% of them reported at least one experience in detecting or suspecting elder abuse. The 76% of participants believed the report has to be submitted to the Judicial Authority only in presence of compelling evidences. Furthermore, the 73% of the sample perceived that healthcare professionals are the main figures who have to cope with elder abuse, however they did not feel as their exclusive role the assessment of the patients’ potential abuse.
Conclusion
Knowledge about elder abuse was limited to physical/psychological issues and, moreover, the legal obligation to report was only poorly known. Imperative is the creation of specific education and training courses, in addition to the need for a multidisciplinary and empathetic approach.",

abstract = "Purpose
This paper describes proposed health care services innovations, provided by a system called CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisted Living eXperiment). CAALYX aimed to provide healthcare innovation by extending the state-of-the-art in tele-healthcare, by focusing on increasing the confidence of elderly people living autonomously, by building on the knowledge base of the most common disorders and respective characteristic vital sign changes for this age group.
Methods
A review of the state-of-the-art on health care services was carried out. Then, extensive research was conducted on the particular needs of the elderly in relation to home health services that, if offered to them, could improve their day life by giving them greater confidence and autonomy. To achieve this, we addressed issues associated with the gathering of clinical data and interpretation of these data, as well as possibilities of automatically triggering appropriate clinical measures. Considering this initial work we started the identification of initiatives, ongoing works and technologies that could be used for the development of the system. After that, the implementation of CAALYX was done.
Findings
The innovation in CAALYX system considers three main areas of contribution: (i) The Roaming Monitoring System that is used to collect information on the well-being of the elderly users; (ii) The Home Monitoring System that is aimed at helping the elders independently living at home being implemented by a device (a personal computer or a set top box) that supports the connection of sensors and video cameras that may be used for monitoring and for interaction with the elder; (iii) The Central Care Service and Monitoring System that is implemented by a Caretaker System where attention and care services are provided to elders, where actors as Caretakers, Doctors and Relatives are logically linked to elders. Innovations in each of these areas are presented here.
Conclusions
The ageing European society is placing an added burden on future generations, as the ‘elderly-to-working-age-people’ ratio is set to steadily increase in the future. Nowadays, quality of life and fitness allows for most older persons to have an active life well into their eighties. Furthermore, many older persons prefer to live in their own house and choose their own lifestyle. The CAALYX system can have a clear impact in increasing older persons’ autonomy, by ensuring that they do not need to leave their preferred environment in order to be properly monitored and taken care of.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify, critically appraise and synthesize qualitative evidence of self-care experiences in health promotion for home-dwelling elders.
Design
A meta-synthesis was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines and using Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument Software.
Data sources
The literature search was conducted on PubMed, CINHAL, Embase, PsycInfo, Eric and ILISI databases from inception up until March 2015. Other articles were searched on Scopus and Web of Knowledge. The reference list of all the identified articles was also searched for additional studies. Studies published in English, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were considered for inclusion in the review.
Review methods
Data from the selected qualitative articles were extracted independently by two reviewers using the data extraction tool of the Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. The meta-synthesis involved the following three steps: the production of a set of statements representing the aggregated data obtained by assembling the findings of qualitative studies; the categorization of findings on the basis of similarity in meaning; and the aggregation of these categories to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. No studies were excluded due to methodological quality.
Results
Of the 4001 records identified, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most articles were conducted in Scandinavian countries and used a phenomenological design. Most elders in the sample were middle-class, cognitively intact, independent, and in good health. The meta-synthesis revealed that older people living at home make decisions about their self-care activities on the basis of their attitudes toward their life and future. These self-care activities are directed toward holistic wellness, prevention and treatment of aging effects, obtaining a sense of satisfaction, and self-realization. Furthermore, self-care activities are settled in a social and relational network that allows old people to take care of themselves and of others or to be cared for by others.
Conclusions
This meta-synthesis presents the perspectives of home-dwelling old people on health-promoting self-care experiences. Such information can help healthcare professionals to maintain long-term autonomy of elders in self-care and to promote healthy aging. Further qualitative research describing self-care experiences of home-dwelling elders from different cultures, education levels, and social backgrounds is needed.",

The study used a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system to survey 250 people aged 65 years and over who lived in their own home. The respondents were recruited from three regions representing the three climate zones in South Australia: semi-arid, warm temperate and temperate. The results show that while the majority of respondents reported being in good health, many lived in dwellings with minimal shading and no wall insulation and appeared to rely on the use of heaters and coolers to achieve thermally comfortable conditions. Concerns over the cost of heating and cooling were shared among the majority of respondents and particularly among people with low incomes. Findings from this study highlight the importance of providing information to older people, carers, designers and policy makers about the interrelationships between weather, housing design, heating and cooling behaviours, thermal comfort, energy use and health and well-being, in order to support older people to age in place independently and healthily.",

abstract = "Background and purpose
There has been much discussion about the risk factors for osteoporosis, but studies involving elderly population in Taiwan are minimal. We aimed to describe variables related to osteoporosis among community dwelling older people in Taiwan.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study. The 671 participants were randomly selected from 3680 examinees of the annual Senior Citizens Health Examination in year 2010. Participants were interviewed with a detailed questionnaire, and 91 of them were invited for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Predictor variables included age, gender and clinical risk factors for osteoporosis. The main outcome was osteoporosis confirmed by DXA.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 75.7±6.4years old. Overall, the most prevalent variables for osteoporosis were height loss in adulthood (41.0%), lack of dairy products or calcium supplements (32.0%) and insufficient physical activity (10.4%). In multivariate models, we found that underweight (OR=9.80) and lack of dairy products/calcium supplements (OR=3.68) were the main variables for osteoporosis. In the subgroup analysis involving only women, underweight (OR=14.60) was the main variable.
Discussion
Among community-dwelling older people in Taiwan, osteoporosis was mainly associated with underweight and lack of dairy products or calcium supplements.
Conclusion
We suggest using the key questions of underweight and dietary pattern in clinical settings to identify high risk people who are candidates for further BMD exam.",

The heterogeneous expert panel (n = 16) in the field of elderly care rated the effect of combinations of trends in the Netherlands on the use of seven healthcare services: i.e. informal, home, general practitioner, acute, specialist, nursing home and mental health care. The percentage and direction of the overall consensus, for the different health services, and for three main trends were analysed.
Results
Experts reached consensus in 57 of 92 ratings (62%). Taking into account the interaction between trends, they expected an extra increase for informal, home, and general practitioner care, but no additional effect of interaction for specialist and acute care. Combinations that included trends leading to less support were expected to lead to an extra increase in utilisation.
Conclusions
Experts expect that interaction between trends will lead to an extra increase in the use of general practitioner, home, and informal care. This increase is mainly the result of interaction with trends leading to less support for older persons. The present results show the need to take the effect of interaction into account when designing new health policy and in research on future healthcare utilisation.",

abstract = "In this paper we reflect on discussions with people of advanced age in Āotearoa New Zealand, and draw on theoretical frameworks of resilience and place in old age, to explore insights about the ways older people maintain quality of life and health. Twenty community-dwelling people of advanced age (85+) were recruited in 2015–16 from a large multidisciplinary longitudinal study of advanced age. These twenty participated in interviews about health in advanced age, impact of illnesses, interactions with clinicians, access to information, support for managing health, and perceptions of primary care, medications, and other forms of assistance. We use a positioning theory framework drawing on thematic and narrative analysis to understand the dynamic ways people in advanced age position themselves and the ways they age well through speech acts and storylines. People in advanced age saw themselves as challenged, rather than threatened, by adversities, and positioned themselves as able to draw on a lifetime of experience and resourcefulness and collaborations with supporters to deal with challenges. Key strategies include downplaying illness and resisting biomedical discourses of complexity, positioning embodied selves as having agency, and creative adaptation in the face of loss. People in advanced age exhibit resilience, maintaining wellbeing, autonomy and good physical and mental quality of life even while living with challenges such as functional decline and multi-morbidities. These findings have significance for supporters of older people, emphasising the need to move away from a narrow focus on problems to working together WITH people in advanced age to offer a more holistic approach that encourages and enhances adaptation and flexibility, rather than rigid and counterproductive coping patterns.",

abstract = "Background
Although frailty of older people has been shown to be associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, evidence on healthcare costs associated with frailty is scarce.
Methods
Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and AMED were electronically searched in January 2019 based on a protocol in accordance with the PRISMA statement using Medical Subjective Heading and free text terms, with explosion functions. Language restriction was not applied. Studies were considered if they were published between 2000 to January 2019 and provided healthcare costs stratified by the frailty status categories among community-dwelling older people with a mean age of 60 years or higher. Reference lists of the included studies were reviewed for additional studies. Healthcare costs according to frailty status were compared using standardized mean difference random-effects meta-analysis.
Results
The systematic review found 3116 citations. After screening for title, abstract, and full-text for eligibility, 5 studies involving 3742362 participants were included. Healthcare costs were compared across three frailty status, robust, prefrailty, and frailty. Both prefrailty (5 studies, Hedges’ g = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.33, p < 0.001) and frailty (5 studies, Hedges’ g = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.61-0.62, p < 0.001) were associated with significantly higher healthcare costs when compared with robustness. There was a high degree of heterogeneity. The risk of publication bias was considered to be low in funnel plots.
Conclusions
This systematic review and meta-analysis found a dose-response increase in the healthcare costs associated with frailty among community-dwelling older adults. Future research should recognize frailty as an important factor associated with increased healthcare costs.",

However understanding of the experience and challenges of living and dying with frailty in older age is currently undeveloped. Frailty is often used as a synonym for the increasing infirmities that accompany ageing and the slow dwindling dying trajectory of many elders. However, there is little empirical work on the experience of being frail to inform social gerontological perspectives and welfare provision. Through analysis of repeated in-depth interviews over 17 months (2006–2008) with 17 frail elders living at home in the U.K., key factors that shape elders’ experience of being frail emerged. The study argues that the visible markers of functional limitations and the increasing social losses of old age bring finitude to the fore. To retain anchorage in this state of imbalance, frail elders work actively to develop and sustain connections to their physical environment, routines and social networks. This experience can be conceptualised as persistent liminality; a state of imbalance “betwixt and between” active living and clinically recognised dying. This paper highlights the precarious and often protracted dying trajectory of frail older people. Whilst it could be argued that developing into death in older age is part of a normal and successful course after a life long-lived, recognition of and support for older people deemed frail is lacking. Frail elders find themselves living in the margin between the Third and Fourth Age with little recognition of or support for the work of living and dying over time. This experience of frailty contests dominant cultural and welfare practices and policy frameworks that operate in binary modes: social or health; independent or dependent; living or dying.",

Care homes provide personal care and support for older people who can no longer be supported in the community. As part of a larger study of integrated working between the NHS and care homes we asked older people how they accessed health care services. Our aim was to understand how older people resident in care homes access health services using the Andersen model of health care access.
Methods
Case studies were conducted in six care homes with different socio-economic characteristics, size and ownership in three study sites. Residents in all care homes with capacity to participate were eligible for the study. Interviews explored how residents accessed NHS professionals. The Andersen model of health seeking behaviour was our analytic framework.
Findings
Thirty-five participants were interviewed with an average of 4 different conditions. Expectations of their health and the effectiveness of services to mitigate their problems were low. Enabling factors were the use of intermediaries (usually staff, but also relatives) to seek access. Residents expected that care home staff would monitor changes in their health and seek appropriate help unprompted.
Conclusions
Care home residents may normalise their health care needs and frame services as unable to remediate these which may combine to disincline older care home residents to seek care. Care access was enabled using intermediaries -either staff or relatives-and the expectation that staff would proactively seek care when they observed new/changed needs. Residents may over-estimate the health-related knowledge of care home staff and their ability to initiate referrals to NHS professionals.",

Our aim was to analyze the effect of HPA-axis functioning as a mediator in the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function, and interactions depending on sex, in healthy older people. To do so, 86 healthy older people (52.3% female) from 60 to 80 years old (M = 67.44, SD = 4.37) completed the revised UCLA loneliness scale. A neuropsychological battery was administered to assess global cognition, processing speed, attention and executive function, working memory, and verbal memory immediate and delayed recall. Saliva samples were provided on two consecutive weekdays to obtain awakening and bedtime cortisol levels, the diurnal cortisol slope (DCS), and the area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg). Our results showed that loneliness was not directly associated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, loneliness was related to higher bedtime cortisol levels, but not to awakening cortisol, the DCS, or the AUCg. In addition, loneliness was associated with worse performance on attention and processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory immediate recall, via bedtime cortisol levels. Therefore, we suggest that HPA-axis functioning is one of the biological mechanisms that mediate the relationship between loneliness and poorer cognitive function. No sex differences were observed in these associations.",

Suicide in older people is a public health concern. Emergency nurses are ideally placed to identify suicide risk. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore emergency nurses’ knowledge, confidence and attitudes about suicide in older people.
Methods
This descriptive exploratory study was conducted in four emergency departments in Sydney, Australia. Data were collected using a 28-item survey from a convenience sample of emergency nurses. Descriptive quantitative statistics and conventional content analysis were performed. Ethics approval was provided.
Results
The response rate was 58% (n = 136); the majority were female with an average of seven years emergency experience. The majority (n = 124, 91%) reported that they frequently managed suicidal behaviour and recognized suicide as a common event (80%). 51% (n = 69) recognized that suicide was a common event for older people. Only 16% (n = 22) reported receiving suicide prevention training with 11% feeling confident in managing suicidal behaviour.
Conclusion
The findings contribute to the discourse on how suicide in older people is recognised by emergency nurses. Few nurses considered it a problem for older people and were not confident about their knowledge. There is a need for suicide prevention training as a priority particularly to identify risks in older people.",

Direct involvement in creative activities can have benefits in terms of improved attention and positive engagement for older people. We used the social return on investment (SROI) approach to explore the social and economic benefits of arts activities for older people living in residential homes in England.
Methods
We complied with the CHEERS checklist and followed the six stages of SROI as reported in the literature.
Results
We identified three main stakeholders: care home residents, care home personnel, and activity co-ordinators. For residents, the outcomes of interest were: community inclusion, mental and physical health, improved cognition and decreased social isolation. For care home personnel and activity co-ordinators the outcomes were: improved skills in caring for older people and increased confidence in using arts interventions. The analysis yielded an SROI of £1.20 for every £1 of expenditure. The sensitivity analysis revealed that when we consider a displacement rate of 15% for all the outcomes of all participating stakeholders, the Imagine study is unlikely to report a ratio that is less than £1.02 for every £1.00 invested.
Conclusions
Findings could inform policy decisions about investment in the arts and health or social care.",

This article examines the trends in morbidities and healthcare utilisation in Malaysian older people aged 60 years and above.
Study design
This is a repeated cross-sectional study.
Methods
Data from three nation-wide community-based surveys, which were conducted in 1996, 2006, and 2015 were analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed for 2015 data to identify factors associated with healthcare utilisation.
Results
Analysis noted increasing trends in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity from 1996 to 2015. Decreasing trends were noted in the prevalence of current smokers and drinkers over this 20-year period, whereas health service utilisation increased with age in all surveys. In 2015, both inpatient and outpatient care are significantly associated with increasing age and diabetes.
Conclusions
Increasing trends of health problems and healthcare utilisation were observed among older people in Malaysia. Policymakers should plan for appropriate resources to meet the challenges of an ageing population in Malaysia.",

abstract = "Background
Person-centred care is widely accepted in health policy as a central focus for health services. However, research studies indicate that, for nurses, the person-centred care of older people with cognitive impairment is challenging.
Aim
This study aimed to compare levels of person-centred care between wards and professional groups (ENs and RNs) providing tertiary hospital care of older people with cognitive impairment.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional survey design, using the 15-item Person-centredness of Older People with cognitive impairment in Acute Care (POPAC) survey instrument, was undertaken.
Results
Nurses working in hospital wards of a tertiary-level health service (n=240; RR=54.3%) responded. Person-centred care was rated lower in wards with higher patient turnover compared to wards with lower patient turnover. Person-centred care was rated higher by enrolled nurses compared to registered nurses.
Discussion
Hospital context, specifically high turnover wards, present a threat to person-centred care, possibly related to the limited time available to undertake the personal care and associated conversations that can enhance nurses’ knowledge of the person. ENs carry more responsibility for these tasks, possibly explaining the variability in person-centred scores between RNs and ENs. In comparison to other studies, nurses in this study had higher average scores for person-centred care, raising measurement as an important challenge in monitoring the implementation of person-centred care policy.
Conclusion
The focus on health service efficiency appears to pose a threat to nurses’ delivery of person-centred care. Further research into the variability between person-centred care of RNs and ENs, and investigation into the practices of other health disciplines would be valuable. Given the importance of person-centred care to the safety and quality of health services, the POPAC addresses the challenge of monitoring person-centred policy initiatives. However, self-report instruments should be balanced with other sources of information about practice.",

This study aims to determine the impact of grandchild care provision on elders’ mental health by self-comparison and longitudinal study design.
Method
Information of 2930 grandparents from the Study of Health and Living Status of the Middle-Aged and Elderly in Taiwan were analysed. Elders’ mental health was evaluated by Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale in both 2003 and 2007. Participants were divided into 4 groups based on their changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren from 2003 to 2007. Chi-square test was used to compare changes in elders’ individual characteristics and total CESD scores between and within groups. ANOVA was used to compare the means of elders’ depressive symptoms between groups while paired-t test was used to compare changes in elders’ depression symptoms from 2003 to 2007. Logistic regression was performed to determine the associations between elders' changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren and changes in depressive symptoms.
Results
Elders continuously caring for grandchildren or started to take care of grandchildren significantly felt happier and enjoyed life more than before and more than elders who do not provide grandchild care. Logistic regression analyses exploring the impact of grandchild care provision found that elders provided no grandchild care had worst mental health amongst all. Elders stopped providing grandchild care had significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms (OR=1.40) than elders provided no grandchild care at all time.
Discussion
By self-comparison, this study illustrates how taking care of grandchildren maintains elders’ mental health, especially against them from loneliness and depression.",

The aim of this article was to synthesize research findings about health care providers’ experiences of patient-centered care in the home setting.
Methods
This is a meta-synthesis of qualitative findings using the analytical method of meta-ethnography developed by Noblit and Hare. We performed a systematic literature search in seven databases and assessed potential studies against eligibility criteria and quality. Subsequently, 10 primary studies were included for analysis.
Results
The core theme “being a balance artist” emerged from the synthesis, incorporating the participants’ experiences when faced with conflicting and competing responsibilities and needs. Two subthemes—“balancing the older clients’ needs against organizational demands” and “balancing the older clients’ needs against professional standards”—further elaborated on this core theme.
Conclusion
Health care providers’ experiences indicate that organizational factors play a crucial role in shaping the conditions for patient-centered care for older people in the home setting.
Practice implications
To motivate and facilitate health care providers to move to a more patient-centered practice, it is important to expand the values of patient-centered care beyond the clinical encounter into the organization.",

Existing evidence on long-term psychotropic polypharmacy in older people is scarce despite serious safety concerns regarding this issue. This study aims to identify distinct trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use and to examine the association with the risk of mortality and unplanned hospitalization according to distinct trajectories.
Design
A retrospective longitudinal cohort study based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).
Setting and participants
A population-based study including 39,803 eligible participants aged 65 years or older who were newly prescribed oral psychotropic agents in 2004.
Measures
We assessed 5 years of monthly consumption of psychotropic agents among eligible participants and used group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct groups of longitudinal psychotropic use. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between distinct trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use and subsequent 1- and 3-year unplanned hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
Results
Among 39,803 eligible participants, we identified 5 trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use over a 5-year follow-up period: sustained intense (7.1%), moderate increasing (12.1%), decreasing (13.4%), slowly increasing (15.7%), and infrequent users (51.6%). Moderate increasing and sustained intense use were associated with significantly higher risks of unplanned hospitalization [moderate increasing use: hazard ratio [HR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.44; sustained intense use: HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.58] and all-cause mortality (moderate increasing use: HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.44; sustained intense use: HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12-1.56) than infrequent use. Similar results were observed at 3 years of follow-up.
Conclusions/Implications
Older people with moderately increasing and sustained intense use of psychotropic agents over time had higher risks of unplanned hospitalization and mortality. Tracking older people's use of psychotropic agents over time may help to identify individuals at greatest risk of unplanned hospitalization and mortality.",

We don´t know how positive emotions are being expressed by patients and health care providers in consultations. The aim of this study is to identify positive emotions expressed by older people and nurse assistants to discuss the function of these in the visits.
Method
This paper presents secondary analysis of consultations in the COMHOME project. In this pilot study, six transcribed consultations between nurse assistants and older people in home health care were analysed using a coding system for positive emotions with seven categories capturing both content and emotional intensity of positive affect.
Results
We found 114 expressions of positive emotions, 63% from nurse assistants and 37% from patients. Patients mostly expressed gratitude, indicating that patients are grateful for being helped. Nurse assistants mostly expressed Praise or Support, indicating that they gave their patients positive affirmation.
Conclusion
The praise and support given by nurse assistants to older people in home health care seemed effective in fostering relationships and maintaining patient resilience. Thus, we claim that emotional talk in communication also should include positive emotions.
Practice Implication
Teaching health care providers about the importance of expressions of positive emotions should be integrated in communication skills training.",

The burden of unrelieved pain experienced by older people and its associated high symptom and economic costs demands consideration of new strategies to better this condition. As the global uptake of digital technology increases, exploring its potential to impact positively on older peoples’ pain self-management practices warrants investigation. This integrative review aimed to evaluate the use of digital health technology for management of older people’s pain across care-settings. Searches were conducted to identify relevant English language studies published in CINHAL, Medline, Academic Search Complete, EMBASE, Cochrane library databases, and Google and Google Scholar websites. A total of 1003 papers were identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by three Phase II randomized controlled trials. These trials demonstrated the feasibility of computer based interactive or instructive video interventions however there was limited evidence to support their use for reduction of pain intensity and interference. Qualitative evidence demonstrated older people’s willingness to use mobile technologies (iPhone or digital pen) to help manage their pain, however, the need of device-use training and connectedness with clinicians were highlighted. In conclusion, there is some evidence that integrating digital health technology into older peoples’ pain self-management plan is feasible and acceptable. However, the provision of high-quality technological interventions informed by a thorough understanding of older people’s digital technology pain management needs is required to ensure greater integration of this technology in clinical practice.",

abstract = "The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during cotton harvesting is critical for securing better health for female cotton pickers in the developing countries where health facilities are not sufficiently available to the masses in the rural areas. Despite increasing the efforts in increasing awareness about the benefits of PPE among the farm workers, a vast majority of the farm workers including pickers don't use the PPE. The present study examines health impacts of cotton harvesting in Pakistani Punjab along with the factors affecting the use of PPE among the cotton pickers. Cross-sectional data collected from Vehari district is used. The study estimates health cost and the use of PPE among the young and elder cotton pickers. Headache, sleeplessness, cough, flue/fever, skin and eyes problems are reported by the young and elder cotton pickers. Personal protective equipment is rarely used during picking. However, the young pickers relatively adopt more PPE compared to the elder cotton pickers. Health cost of cotton picking is US$2.96 and 3.06 per season during the year for the young and elder cotton pickers, respectively. Results of logit model show that health cost, age, education below 8th grade, perception of temporary impact and health problems are important determinants of adopting PPE among the cotton pickers. The findings of the study conclude that the use of PPE can be realized through proper training and education of cotton pickers and farm workers.",

Emergency department presentations by older people associated with mental health and drug and alcohol related conditions are increasing. However, the characteristics of presentations by older people in Australia are largely unknown. The aim of this research was to explore the characteristics of older people presenting with mental health and drug and alcohol conditions.
Procedures
We used a retrospective electronic medical record audit to explore all emergency department presentations by older people 65 years and over for mental health and drug and alcohol related conditions over a 12 month period. Data were described using descriptive statistics.
Finidngs
There were 40,093 presentations; 2% (n=900) were related to mental health or drug and alcohol related conditions. Presentations were mainly associated with primary mental or medical symptoms. The majority were female (n=471; 53%). Predominate conditions were cognitive impairment (n=234; 26%) and affective disorders (n=233; 26.0%). Sixty-three percent of patients were admitted to a hospital ward. Over the study period 106 patients (242 episodes of care) represented.
Principle conclusions
Given the ageing population and increasing prevalence for mental health and drug and alcohol conditions, strategies are required to better recognise these conditions to reduce the burden on the health care system and improve health for older people.",

To make medicines easier to swallow, many people will modify the medication dosage form e.g. split or crush tablets, and open capsules. Some of the challenges associated with administering medicines to older people, and issues with dosage form modification will be reviewed.

Falls are the most common cause of serious injuries and are a major health threat in the stratum of older population. Early detection of a fall is a key factor when trying to provide adequate care to elderly person who has suffered an accident at home. Therefore, the detection of falls in the elderly remains a major challenge in the field of public health. Specific actions aimed at the fall detection can provide urgent care which allows, on the other hand, drastically reduce the cost of medical care, and improve primary care service. In this paper, we present a support system for detecting falls of an elder person by the combination of a wearable wireless sensor node based on an accelerometer and a static wireless non-intrusive sensory infrastructure based on heterogeneous sensor nodes. This previous infrastructure called DIA (Dispositivo Inteligente de Alarma, in Spanish) is an AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) system that allows to infer a potential fall. This inference is reinforced for prompt attention by a specific sensorisation at portable node sensor in order to help distinguish between falls and daily activities of assisted person. The wearable node will not determine a falling situation, it will advice the reasoner layer about specific acceleration patterns that could, eventually, imply a falling. Is at the higher layer where the falling is determined from the whole context produced by mesh of fixed nodes. Experimental results have shown that the proposed system obtains high reliability and sensitivity in the detection of the fall.",

Medication adherence is a key factor of the therapy of chronic diseases in older people with chronic diseases. Inadequate health literacy results in poor health outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of health literacy on medication adherence to provide information for improving health outcomes in older people with chronic disease. This was a cross-sectional study of older people (people aged over 65 years) with chronic diseases in Korea taking one or more medications for 6 months and over from an academic referral medical center. Each patient completed a structured questionnaire by interview or self-report. Of the 291 older participants, 30.6% had high medication adherence. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis, health literacy was the strongest predictor of medication adherence (β=0.190, P=0.001). In addition, perceived health status, use of magnifying glass, and assistance with medication administration were also significant factors related to medication adherence. In conclusion, enhancing health literacy may improve medication adherence of older people with chronic disease. The development, implementation and evaluation of health literacy interventions for older people with chronic conditions are important to increase medication adherence and potentially improve patient outcomes. Such programs would also raise awareness of the impact of health literacy on patient outcomes. Furthermore, this could contribute to reducing health inequalities worldwide.",

The purpose of the study was to explore experiences of older people with cancer in ascertaining the attributes of a person-centred approach in sustaining hope and enabling human flourishing. This was a qualitative study comparing patients and professional experiences and perceptions of care across to ward settings.
Methods
Methods involved 10 semi-structured interviews conducted with patients and focus groups (n = 6) and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals. Three dissemination focus groups (n = 14) were also carried out with professionals to allow further analysis of the data.
Results
Two main themes were identified, including ‘Emotional adaptations of hope: wants and expectations’ and ‘Hope through belittling their illness’. Findings highlight the way hope is conveyed and the emphasis' accorded to issues such as societal perceptions, knowledge, expectations of care, life stage, relationships, identity, and emotions. Findings also reinforce the importance of maintaining hope, recognising the different ways hope is used, and enabling patients to flourish.
Conclusion
This study highlights how hope is facilitated through the interaction between patients and professionals and that the relational interactive stance. This current study establishes that hope seemed to be temporal, contextual and dynamic in nature, involving an ongoing process. Helping older people with cancer to understand their illness considering the situation of lives and experiences is essential to address expectations and wants.",

The number of older people is increasing rapidly and these demographical changes put a large stress on the health care system. Furthermore, as most older people wish to age-in-place, adequate ageing-in-place strategies become significantly important. Housing impacts health, therefore appropriate and comfortable housing is a key determinant to facilitate older people to age-in-place. One of the aspects of concern is thermal comfort; however, the thermal requirements of older people differ from those of young adults. They are also relatively vulnerable to thermal conditions outside the generally accepted range. This ’10 Questions' contribution addresses issues related to thermal comfort and ageing and argues that the current models for assessing thermal comfort are not sufficiently accurate to be used for older adults. It also discusses approaches to facilitate ageing-in-place including the use of smart home technologies. The paper is based on extensive literature review of numerous relevant studies relating to thermal comfort, physiological differences between older and younger people, the relationship between thermal environment, comfort and health, as well as housing design and smart home technologies for older people.",

abstract = "Background
Prevention of problematic alcohol use is mainly focused on younger adults, while heavy drinking in middle-aged and older adults might be more frequent with more impact on functioning and health care use. Therefore, alcohol use and alcohol disorder in both age groups was compared. To facilitate age-specific prevention, it was examined whether risk factors of heavy drinking and impact on functioning and health care use differs across the life-span.
Methods
Data of people (23–70 years) were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (N = 4618), a general population-based cohort. Heavy alcohol use was defined as >14 drinks/week for women and >21 drinks/week for men. Alcohol disorder was defined as DSM-IV disorder of alcohol abuse and/or alcohol dependence. (Multinomial) logistic regression analyses were used to study risk factors of alcohol use and associations between alcohol use and health care use and functioning.
Results
The past-year prevalence of heavy alcohol was higher in older (55–70 years) compared to younger people (6.7% versus 3.8%), whereas alcohol disorder was less prevalent (1.3% versus 3.9%). Heavy alcohol use was associated with higher level of education in older adults compared to younger adults. Other characteristics of problematic alcohol use and its impact on functioning and health care use did not differ between age groups.
Conclusions
Heavy drinking is more prevalent among middle-aged and older people. Contrary to younger adults, prevention of heavy alcohol use in those aged 55–70 should focus on higher educated people.",

This percentage is even lower (9.8%) in urban China. It is, therefore, important to understand the pathways by which physical activity behaviors are impacted by the built environment. This study utilized a mixed methods approach—interviews (n = 42) and longitudinal (2010–2015) health survey data (n = 3094) for older people residing in three neighborhoods in Huainan, a mid-sized city in Anhui Province, central eastern China. First, a content analysis of interview data was used to identify individual and built environment factors (motivators and barriers) that impacted physical activity within older people's activity spaces. Second, a multilevel path analysis was conducted using the health survey data to demonstrate the pathways by which these motivators and barriers contributed to the initiation, regulation, and maintenance of physical activity. This study found (a) that the liveliness of an apartment building and its proximity to functional spaces (fast-food stores, farmer's markets, supermarkets, pharmacies, schools, hospitals, PA facilities and natural and man-made water bodies) were important factors in attracting sedentary older people to initiate physical activity; (b) the social networks of apartment neighbors helped to initiate, regulate, and maintain physical activity; and housing closeness to functional spaces was important in maintaining physical activity, particularly for those older people with chronic diseases. To increase older people's overall physical activity, future interventions should focus on residential form and access to functional spaces, prior to investing in large-scale urban design interventions.",

abstract = "Singapore is one of the fastest-aging populations due to increased life expectancy and lowered fertility. Lifestyle changes increase the burden of chronic diseases and disability. These have important implications for social protection systems. The goal of this paper is to model future functional disability and healthcare expenditures based on current trends. To project the health, disability and hospitalization spending of future elders, we adapted the Future Elderly Model (FEM) to Singapore. The FEM is a dynamic Markov microsimulation model developed in the US. Our main source of population data was the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) consisting of 63,000 respondents followed up over three waves from 1993 to 2010. The FEM model enables us to investigate the effects of disability compounded over the lifecycle and hospitalization spending, while adjusting for competing risk of multi-comorbidities. Results indicate that by 2050, 1 in 6 elders in Singapore will have at least one ADL disability and 1 in 3 elders will have at least one IADL disability, an increase from 1 in 12 elders and 1 in 5 elders respectively in 2014. The highest prevalence of functional disability will be in those aged 85 years and above. Lifetime hospitalization spending of elders aged 55 and above is US$24,400 (30.2%) higher among people with functional disability compared to those without disability. Policies that successfully tackle diabetes and promote healthy living may reduce or delay the onset of disability, leading to potential saving. In addition, further technological improvements may reduce the financial burden of disability.",

Background
Taiwan is an aging society by the definition of the World Health Organization. The trend of elder population is one of the fastest worldwide. The Taiwan Foundation for Geriatric Emergency and Critical Care dedicates to disseminate health promotion behaviors for community elders and middle age adults. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and satisfaction of the health education programs on health promotion behaviors.
Methods
A one-group pretest-posttest study was conducted using purposively sampling of participants of the health education programs at five community care centers in the great Taipei metropolitan area. A structure questionnaire was developed to collect data. SPSS 20.0 was used in statistical analysis.
Results
Above 40% of 136 participants were either overweight or obesity. Comparing pretest and posttest scores, the changes in mentality, perceived health, physical exercise, and blood pressure measurement were significant (p < 0.05). The overall satisfaction with the health education programs was high (3.62). It was found the correlation between marital status and perceived health was positive (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
The health education programs specifically for elders and middle age adults in community care centers were effective in raising the awareness of health promotion behaviors. The success could provide a reference for future studies developing health promotion and education programs and holistic care for community elders and middle age adults in Taiwan.",

Alzheimer disease (AD) can affect masticatory function, affecting oral health–related quality of life (OHRQoL). Whether oral rehabilitation with conventional removable prostheses can restore masticatory function and improve OHRQoL in these individuals is unknown.
Purpose
The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the influence of oral rehabilitation with removable prostheses on masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL in elders with and without AD.
Material and methods
Thirty-two elders with mild AD (n=16, mean age=76.7 ±6.3 years) or without AD (n=16, mean age=75.2 ±4.4 years) were recruited. All participants first underwent masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL evaluations, and 2 months after insertion of new removable prostheses, the variables were reassessed. Masticatory efficiency was determined using the sieving method, and OHRQoL was measured by applying the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). The data from the baseline and after insertion of the new removable prostheses were compared by paired t test. Group differences at each time point were assessed by t test (α=.05).
Results
After insertion of the new removable prostheses, masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL improved in both the elders with AD and the control. At baseline, elders with AD had lower masticatory efficiency and higher OHRQoL than controls (P<.05). After removable prosthesis insertion, elders with AD continued to show lower masticatory efficiency values than controls, but their OHRQoL was similar.
Conclusions
Oral rehabilitation with new removable prostheses improved the masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL of elders with and without AD, although masticatory efficiency did not reach control levels in elders with AD.",

The prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among older people is high. Screening for CRC presents a cost-effective secondary prevention and control strategy which results in a significant reduction in mortality. This study aims to describe the prevalence of CRC screening and examine its risk factors among Chinese community-dwelling older people guided by a comprehensive model combining Health Belief Model and Extended Parallel Processing Model.
Methods
A descriptive correlational study was conducted. A convenience sample of 240 community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 was recruited in May–July in 2012 in Hong Kong. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire which collected information on demographic variables, CRC-related psychosocial variables and whether they had a CRC screening in the past 10 years.
Results
Among the participants, 25.4% reported having a CRC screening test. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that participants with a higher level in cue to action, and lower perceived knowledge barriers and severity-fear were significantly associated with participation in CRC screening. But there were no significant associations between fatalism and cancer fear with screening.
Conclusions
The prevalence of CRC screening was low in Hong Kong Chinese community-dwelling elders. A number of modifiable factors associated with CRC screening were identified which provides specific targets for interventions. This study also adds to the knowledge regarding the associations between fatalism and fear with CRC screening behaviors among Chinese older people.",

abstract = "Background
An intervention ‘Better Oral Health in Home Care’ was introduced (2012–2014) to improve the oral health of older people receiving community aged care services. Implementation of the intervention was theoretically framed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Process outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in older people’s oral health.
Objective
To evaluate the extent to which the intervention has been embedded and sustained into routine community aged care practice 3 years after the initial implementation project.
Design
A Realist Evaluation applying Normalisation Process Theory within a single case study setting.
Setting
Community aged care (home care) provider in South Australia, Australia.
Participants
Purposeful sampling was undertaken. Twelve staff members were recruited from corporate, management and direct care positions. Two consumers representing high and low care recipients also participated.
Methods
Qualitative methods were applied in two subcases, reflecting different contextual settings. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and analysed deductively by applying the Normalisation Process Theory core constructs (with the recommended phases of the Realist Evaluation cycle). Retrospective and prospective analytic methods investigated how the intervention has been operationalised by comparing two timeframes: Time 1 (Implementation June 2012–December 2014) and Time 2 (Post-implementation July 2017–July 2018).
Results
At Time 1, the initial program theory proposed that multi-level facilitation contributed to a favourable context that triggered positive mechanisms supportive of building organisational and workforce oral healthcare capacity. At Time 2, an alternative program theory of how the intervention has unfolded in practice described a changed context following the withdrawal of the project facilitation processes with the triggering of alternative mechanisms that have made it difficult for staff to embed sustainable practice.
Conclusion
Findings concur with the literature that successful implementation outcomes do not necessarily guarantee sustainability. The study has provided a deeper explanation of how contextual characteristics have contributed to the conceptualisation of oral healthcare as a low priority, basic work-ready personal care task and how this, in turn, hindered the embedding of sustainable oral healthcare into routine community aged care practice. This understanding can be used to better inform the development of strategies, such as multi-level facilitation, needed to navigate contextual barriers so that sustainable practice can be achieved.",

Parkinson disease (PD) symptoms, such as muscle rigidity, tremors in the lips and tongue, and involuntary mandibular movements, may cause oral health-related problems, mastication difficulties, and denture discomfort because of the difficulty in controlling a prosthesis with the oral musculature.
Purpose
The purpose of this observational clinical study was to evaluate the influence of oral rehabilitation with a removable prosthesis on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and masticatory efficiency (ME) in elders with PD.
Material and methods
Thirty-four elders with PD (n=17, mean age 69.4 ±4.7 years) or without PD (n=17, mean age 70.7 ±4.7 years) were recruited. All participants first underwent OHRQoL and ME evaluations. Two months after the insertion of new removable prostheses, the participants were reassessed. The OHRQoL was measured with the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-49). ME was evaluated by determining the percentage weight of the comminuted silicone-based artificial material that passed through a 2.8 mm sieve. For each group, data were compared between baseline and after insertion of new removable prostheses by paired t test or Wilcoxon sign test/signed-rank test. Group differences were assessed at each time point by t test (α=.05).
Results
After the insertion of removable prostheses, elders with PD showed improved OHRQoL and ME. Controls also showed improvements on both measures after insertion of removable prostheses. At baseline, elders with PD had lower OHRQoL and ME compared with the controls (P<.05). After removable prosthesis insertion, the elders with PD continued to show lower ME values than the controls, but their OHRQoL was similar.
Conclusions
Oral rehabilitation with new removable dental prostheses improved the OHRQoL and ME in elders with and without PD, although ME did not reach control levels in elders with PD.",

Empty nest has been becoming the main family pattern among old people, and influencing the traditional family providing for the aged in China. This study aimed to investigate the association of empty nest with depressive symptom in a Chinese elderly population.
Methods
Our study was based on the baseline investigation of Zhejiang Major Public Health Surveillance which was conducted in 2014. The final analyzed sample consisted of 9215 participants aged no less than 60 years. Subjects completed a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, living arrangements, behavioral risk factors, health status, subjective assessments, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale.
Results
More than half of the participants were empty nest elders (57.4%). The overall prevalence of depressive symptom was 10.3%, while it was higher in empty nest group than in non-empty nest group (11.6% vs. 8.6%, P<0.001). A positive association was found between empty nest and depressive symptom, the OR (95%CI) was 1.223(1.045, 1.431). After stratified by gender/age/education level/employment status, this association was just prominent in participants of male, 70 years old and above, primary school education, and retirees. No matter living with spouse or living alone, empty nesters were more likely to have depressive symptoms than non-empty nesters.
Limitations
Cross-sectional study could not make a causation conclusion. The social supports of participants were not been investigated in detail.
Conclusions
Empty nest elders, especially those who are male, 70 years old and above, primary school education, and retired, are more vulnerable to depressive symptom.",

abstract = "In a depopulated region where population aging is advancing, it is necessary to establish a method so local residents themselves can be actively involved in older people’s health promotion. Net Step Exercise, a novel dual-task walking program, introduced residents to opportunities for physical activities and social participation without any health specialist support. In one depopulated town (Ikeda, Nakagawa-gun, Hokkaido, Japan), volunteer residents have held Net Step Exercise classes throughout the town since 2007. We longitudinally examined the influence of volunteer-led Net Step Exercise class participation on subsequent self-rated health in all individuals aged 70–79 years living in Ikeda. A total of 662 people who completed a baseline mail-in questionnaire survey in 2012 were followed until 2014. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association with self-rated health after two years of class participation once a month or more at baseline, after controlling for confounds such as age, sex, years of education, living alone, baseline self-rated health, regular exercise, and other physical activities. The odds ratio of poor self-rated health in older people who participated in classes was 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.85) compared to older people not participating in classes. Even after confounding factors were adjusted, the odds ratio of class participation was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29–0.85). This study showed that participation in volunteer-led Net Step Exercise might prevent poor self-rated health. Such Net Step Exercise classes are a feasible method for older people’s health promotion in depopulated municipalities.",

When a disaster occurs older people are recognised to be among one of the vulnerable population groups. During the Great East Japan earthquake in 2011, there were numerous unresolved health and social issues for the survivors.
Aim of the study
To understand which challenges older people that survived the 2011 disaster faced, which aspects they identified as concerns and what they felt was difficult and possibly could not recover from in the near future.
Methods
A qualitative case study method was used. Sixteen participants, living in temporary housing, were interviewed in 2015. The interview data was analysed using thematic analysis.
Findings and discussion
Participants (4 men; 12 women) were aged between 65 and 89 years. Seven participants stated that they were healthy although they had minor health issues. Some women had psycho-social health issues brought about by the trauma they experienced, caring for their aging relatives and living in temporary housing. Four themes emerged: feeling grateful to be alive; issues related to health and mental health; the importance of recreational activities and community involvement; feeling of fear, uncertainty and vulnerability.
Conclusions
This is the first study to report directly participants’ feelings and views after their traumatic experience. All participants were happy to be interviewed and to express their views. Although participants expressed their need for health professional services to be available to support them following traumatic events, these services are yet to be recognised as an essential part of the recovery process.",

However, elders’ privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication. To show that elders’ privacy could be substantially exposed, in this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders’ movement activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS in deducing and disclosing elders’ privacy, which might be maliciously exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.",

abstract = "Background
Steadily increasing numbers of older people and people in need of care represent critical challenges for today’s society. In the last years, diverse (health-related) technologies have been developed to facilitate living at home for older people but also to support (professional) care personnel in their daily care efforts. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have the potential to enhance safety, support medical therapy, or facilitate everyday chores and social life. With the huge range and variety of technical opportunities, the question arises what influences (potential) users’ decisions for the right technology in their individual conditions and situations. In particular with regard to the fragility of the care situation, it is unknown which technologies are desired for different care needs and diverse situations.
Objectives
The present study investigates (1) personal care needs as a potential influencing parameter for technology acceptance and (2) the selection of specific technologies.
Method
In an online questionnaire (including n = 162 people of all ages), technology acceptance and the selection of specific technologies was assessed, using two scenarios differing in their personal care needs (low care needs vs. moderate care needs) in two situational contexts (emergency detection vs. medical reminders).
Results
Personal care needs influence the perception of benefits, barriers, and general acceptance of assisting technologies, independent from situational context. Higher needs for care lead to higher acknowledgements of the technology’s benefits, lower agreements or, in parts, higher rejections of potential barriers and higher acceptance. The two care situations differ regarding the participants’ preferences for technologies: For emergency detection, smart watches and emergency buttons are clearly accepted. In contrast, cameras are consistently rejected. For situations in which medical reminders are used, smartphone and smartwatches are most wanted, whereas audio assistants and smart TV were rather rejected.
Conclusions
The results provide insights into users’ preferences for specific technologies for the purpose of emergency detection and medical reminders as well as for the important influence of personal care needs. These insights can be used to derive user-tailored solutions of technology configurations for specific care needs and situations.",

Recent improved capabilities in both ambient and wearable technologies, especially those related with video and lifelogging data, and huge advances in the accuracy of intelligent systems for AAL are leading to more valuable and trustworthy services for older people and their caregivers. These advances have been particularly relevant in the last years due to the appearance of RGB-D devices and the development of deep learning systems. This article reviews these latest developments in the intersection of AAL, intelligent systems, lifelogging, and computer vision. This paper provides a study of previous reviews in these fields, and later analyses newer intelligent techniques employed with different video-based lifelogging technologies in order to offer lifelogging services for AAL.

abstract = "Statistics show that a bathroom is one of the most hazardous places especially for older people. Older people typically have greater difficulties with mobility and balance, making them more vulnerable to fall and slip injuries in a bathroom and causing serious health issues related to short and long-term well-being. Various components in a bathroom including shower, tub, floor, and toilet have been re-designed, and independently upgraded their ergonomics and safety aspects; however, the number of bathroom injuries remains consistently high in general. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a new concept applicable to almost everywhere and man-made objects. Wireless sensors detect abnormalities and send data through the network. A large amount of data can be collected from multiple IoT systems and it can be utilized for a big data analysis. The big data may reveal a hidden positive outcome beyond the initially intended purposes. A few commercial IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and intelligent transportation systems are available. Nevertheless, An IoT application for a bathroom is not currently known. Unlike other applications, bathrooms have some unique aspects such as privacy and wet environment. This paper presents a holistic conceptual approach of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system development and implementation to enhance bathroom safety. The concept focuses on the application in a large nursing care facility as a pilot testing bed. Authors propose 1) sensor selection and application, 2) integration of a wireless sensor local network system, 3) design concept for IoT implementation, and 4) a big data analysis system model in this paper.",

The case study – dealing with the introduction of care robots in a care facility for the elderly – will be examined by an ethnographical qualitative analysis as well as by three theoretical approaches often used in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). We combine these three approaches with an ethnographical analysis to achieve a deeper understanding of several difficulties with pTD that are typical in the realization within the AAL field, especially when a mediating method, such as SBD, is adopted. In this respect the theoretical contribution consists of outlining the importance of a strictly bottom-up view on pTD. Finally, we conclude with two general recommendations on how the inclusion of care workers and older people as target groups of pTD within the AAL field can be accomplished more successfully.",

Hence, Quality Criteria (QCs) must be identified and well defined to successfully achieve the system purposes. The goal is to obtain a set of data quality characteristics that would be applicable to the context of AAL systems and evaluate them using data coming from multiple sensors. To do this, we based our work on ISO/IEC 25012 and ISO/IEC 25010 standards that establish QCs respectively on system and software product quality and data quality, to extract the most relevant QCs that could be more fitting for AAL systems. We have applied an approach to extract the most important criteria than can be associated with AAL system based on the acquisition, the transmission, and the treatment processes. To convince all stakeholders including both technologies and end users of AAL systems, high quality must be guaranteed, but measuring quality in AAL system is difficult because of the variety of stakeholders. To evaluate the entire data quality model for AAL system, we will apply an evaluation procedure on this model, which consists first make our model hierarchically, then evaluate it using the metrics based on the sensor data and the concept of fuzzy logic.",

Compared with other European countries, older people in Romania experience high rates of poverty and disability. In this, the first study to investigate wellbeing in older Romanian people attending public and third sector day facilities, we tested our hypotheses, based on a successful aging model, that greater wellbeing would be associated with a healthier lifestyle (lower levels of alcohol consumption and smoking), better physical health, mental health, social support (less loneliness) and absence of abuse.
Methods
Older people (65+) without significant cognitive impairment, recruited from three Bucharest social care centers, completed structured questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5).
Results
100/140 (71%) eligible potential participants approached participated; mean WHO-5 score was 67.7 (standard deviation=20.7); 25 (25%) scored <50, indicating low wellbeing. In our final model, lower depression (β=−0.40, t=−3.8, p<0.001) and loneliness scores (β=−0.22, t=−2.1, p=0.034) predicted higher wellbeing. More physical health problems and hospitalisations were associated with lower wellbeing on univariate analyses, but not in the final model. Screening positive for abuse (23 (23%) of participants), activities of daily living, alcohol and smoking status did not predict wellbeing.
Conclusions
Despite experiencing high rates of loneliness, depression, anxiety and abuse, this population of older, Romanian people receiving social support, reported wellbeing levels comparable to European working populations. Loneliness was a more important predictor of lower wellbeing than any other factors studied. Tailored interventions to reduce loneliness in Romanian older people receiving community social support would be a rational next step.",

This study investigated the prevalence of elder abuse in nursing homes and its associated demographic, clinical factors and QOL in Macau and Guangzhou, China. A total of 681 subjects (244 in Macau and 437 in Guangzhou) were consecutively recruited. The prevalence of elder abuse was 11.48% and 8.24% in Macau and Guangzhou, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that having a religion and depressive symptoms were independently and positively associated with elder abuse. No significant association between elder abuse and any QOL domain was found. Elder abuse is common in nursing homes in both Macau and Guangzhou. Appropriate strategies and educational programs should be developed for health professionals to reduce the risk of elder abuse.",

A fall not assisted in time can cause functional impairment in an elder and a significant decrease in his mobility, independence and life quality. In that sense, the present work proposes an innovative IoT-based system for detecting falls of elderly people in indoor environments, which takes advantages of low-power wireless sensor networks, smart devices, big data and cloud computing. For this purpose, a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN device wearable is used, which is responsible for collecting data from movements of elderly people in real-time. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, the sensor readings are processed and analyzed using a decision trees-based Big Data model running on a Smart IoT Gateway. If a fall is detected, an alert is activated and the system reacts automatically by sending notifications to the groups responsible for the care of the elderly people. Finally, the system provides services built on cloud. From medical perspective, there is a storage service that enables healthcare professional to access to falls data for perform further analysis. On the other hand, the system provides a service leveraging this data to create a new machine learning model each time a fall is detected. The results of experiments have shown high success rates in fall detection in terms of accuracy, precision and gain.",

The purpose of this study is to determine Sundanese family habits in caring for older people with diabetes in Tasikmalaya, West Java, Indonesia.
Method
This study using a qualitative phenomenological method, via in-depth interviews, in which the saturation point was reached at the ten participants. The ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, maleficence, and justice were applied.
Results
This study identified two main topics: first, family ability to perform family health tasks and second, the different types of family cultures that influence taking care of the health of older people, which were reflected through several sub-topics, namely, pampering the parents, doing everything they asked, and controlling all their activities. The habits of pampering and assenting to the wishes of older people with diabetes are highly risky, as, when they are food-related, they can increase blood glucose.
Conclusion
The findings of this study reveal that the family habits which highly risky to increase blood glucose older people must be changed through negotiation efforts and cultural restructuring, such that the treatments provided are in accordance with the diabetes management pattern. The results of the present study are useful in improving health services for older people with diabetes in the multicultural country of Indonesia.",

The characteristics of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) are appropriate to fulfill elderly needs. However, the current state of development is still mostly oriented to a technological perspective, where the individual's functionality has not been fully addressed. Under the Living Usability Lab project we have defined a methodology and created some evaluation tools for assessment of AAL services according to a Living Lab perspective, based on the ICF.

In particular, we propose an algorithm based on a heuristic and machine learning to detect ‘long-lie’ situations. The proposed algorithm minimizes the effects of noise present in the RFID information by relying on eight features extracted using only binary tag observation information from a possible location of a fall on the smart carpet. By evaluating the proposed approach with broadly scripted activities, which included a complex set of walking patterns, we show that the proposed algorithm depicts a good overall performance of 93% F-score.",

Productive activities included working and/or taking care of any (great)grandchild(ren) in the past 12 months prior to the survey. Using paired t-tests and probit models, we compared the differences in these productive activities among older people in terms of sex and living area. The results from various t-tests showed that educational attainment, health status and poverty status were key factors differentiating older men and women and rural and urban older people in these productive activities. For the probit estimations in terms of both gender and living location, the results indicated that age, education, health status and supportive children were determinants of working decision, while age, marital status and size of household were consistently important factors of taking care of (great)grandchildren. The paper also discussed policy implications for socio-economic and health protection in promoting older people's productive activities as well as protecting them from a variety of risks and vulnerabilities.",

It is well established that social exclusion is a key social determinant of health; however, such association between social exclusion and health outcomes among older people remain a relatively under-researched area. This paper explores the effects of four dimensions of social exclusion on self-rated health and depression among older people in China.
Methods
This paper includes 8038 individuals aged 60 and over from the first wave national multi-stage probability sample (2014) from the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS). Descriptive univariate information for individual variables and four dimensions of social exclusion are presented. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models are used to examine the associations between social exclusion and self-rated health and depression.
Results
Older people who were in the lower level of exclusion from social relationships or subjective feelings of exclusion were significantly less likely to report fair or poor self-rated health than people in the higher level of exclusion (lower level of exclusion from social activities was significantly associated with being less likely to report poor SRH only). Older people who were in the lower level of subjective feeling of exclusion or exclusion from financial products were significantly less likely to report depression.
Conclusions
Different dimensions of social exclusion have different effects on self-rated health and depression. Social policies need to reflect this and efforts of services could usefully be oriented to prevent multi-dimensions of social exclusion. Ultimately, such policies should have the potential to enhance the health of older people in China.",

Objectives
We aimed to (1) summarize the research literature regarding the cost-effectiveness of exercise-based programs for falls prevention in older people and (2) discuss the implications of the review's findings for clinical practice and future research on the dosage of cost-effective exercise-based falls prevention programs for older people.
Methods
Multiple databases were searched from inception until February 2019. Studies were included if they (1) were randomized controlled trials with an economic evaluation of exercise-based falls prevention programs for people ≥ 60 years old and (2) assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost per quality-adjusted life year, incremental cost per fall and benefit-to-cost ratio of programs. Methodological quality was assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale and quality of economic evaluation with the Quality of Health Economic Studies.
Results
We included 12 studies (3668 older people). Interventions for falls prevention were either exercise-only or multifactorial programs. Five studies of high economic quality and 2 of high methodological quality provided evidence supporting exercise-only programs as cost-effective for preventing falls in older people. Specifically, a tailored exercise program including strengthening of lower extremities, balance training, cardiovascular exercise, stretching and functional training of moderate intensity performed twice per week with each session lasting 60min for ≥ 6 months delivered in groups of 3 to 8 participants with home-based follow-up appears to be cost-effective in preventing falls in older people.
Conclusion
There is evidence to support exercise-based interventions as cost-effective treatment for preventing falls. Further research is needed to fully establish the cost-effectiveness of such programs, especially in both developing and underdeveloped countries.

abstract = "Introduction
Elder abuse (abuse/violence/neglect or disrespect as defined by BKPAI data) among elderly is a deserted and overlooked issue especially in developing countries including India.
Aim
To assess the elder abuse and its association with socio-demographic factors among elderly population.
Materials and Methods
This study comprises data from BKPAI 2011. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis have been used for the following study.
Results
A total of 9852 elderly people were included in this study which was carried out in seven states of India. The mean age of the study subjects was 68.04±7.29 years. Among 9852 elderly people 10% (987) were faced elder abuse. In unadjusted odd-ratio the status of elder abuse was found statistically significant with state, type of residence, sex, age group, caste, education, marital status, migration status, occupation, health condition and economic dependency etc. But in binary logistic regression analysis state, type of residence, sex, education, caste and their migration status were found statistically significant with elder abuse.
Conclusion
From the result of this study, the existence of “violence”, “neglect”, and “disrespect” within the society and community is approved. The problems of abuse among older persons were more mental than physical and elderly at getting older, without partner, with bad health condition, having less money or with no security are on more risk of getting abused.",

abstract = "In recent years several world-wide ambient assisted living (AAL) programs have been activated in order to improve the quality of life of older people, and to strengthen the industrial base through the use of information and communication technologies. An important issue is extending the time that older people can live in their home environment, by increasing their autonomy and helping them to carry out activities of daily livings (ADLs). Research in the automatic detection of falls has received a lot of attention, with the object of enhancing safety, emergency response and independence of the elderly, at the same time comparing the social and economic costs related to fall accidents. In this work, an algorithmic framework to detect falls by using a 3D time-of-flight vision technology is presented. The proposed system presented complementary working requirements with respect to traditional worn and non-worn fall-detection devices. The vision system used a state-of-the-art 3D range camera for elderly movement measurement and detection of critical events, such as falls. The depth images provided by the active sensor allowed reliable segmentation and tracking of elderly movements, by using well-established imaging methods. Moreover, the range camera provided 3D metric information in all illumination conditions (even night vision), allowing the overcoming of some typical limitations of passive vision (shadows, camouflage, occlusions, brightness fluctuations, perspective ambiguity). A self-calibration algorithm guarantees different setup mountings of the range camera by non-technical users. A large dataset of simulated fall events and ADLs in real dwellings was collected and the proposed fall-detection system demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity.",

In this paper, we present two data-driven models (a field study model and a lab study model) using the algorithm of random forests to predict older people's thermal sensation. These two models were developed from a field study dataset and a lab study dataset separately. The field study dataset was collected from 1040 old subjects (70 + years) who lived in 19 aged-care homes, which contains multi-dimension factors such as environmental parameters, subjects' demographic information, health condition, acclimatization degrees, living habits and thermal perceptions' votes. The lab study dataset was collected from a lab study and contains 18 old subjects' (65 + years) eight local skin temperatures and thermal perceptions' votes under five thermal environments (21/23/26/29/32 °C). After the procedure of feature selection, the field study model was developed with four environmental variables (air temperature, velocity, CO2 concentration, illuminance) plus two human-related variables (health condition and living time in aged-care homes) as inputs. It produced an overall accuracy of 56.6%, which was 24.9% higher than that of the PMV model. The lab study model was built on five local skin temperatures including head, lower arm, upper leg, chest and back temperatures, which demonstrated an overall accuracy of 76.7%, 30.1% higher than UC Berkeley thermal sensation model's accuracy. We then interpreted how these inputs distinguish thermal sensations by applying a partial dependence analysis. Finally, we proposed two applications of the above models and present older people's seasonally neutral indoor temperature zones.",

In the past century, elder abuse has become an important health issue and a stressful event that negatively affects the physical and mental health of the elders.
Aims
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of elder abuse in Iran through systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
All articles about elderly abuse in Iran since 2005–2017 were searched using the Google Scholar search engine, four Iranian databases (Magiran, IranMedex, SID) and six international English language databases(Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Pubmed, Science Direct-Embase) with keywords of Elder Abuse, Elder Mistreatment, Elder Neglect, Abuse and a combination of these keywords. After examining the entry and exit criteria and qualitative evaluation of the articles, Data was analyzed by comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software.
Findings
In a systematic review, 15 articles on elders in Iran were included in the study. The overall prevalence of elder abuse was 48.3% (with 95% confidence interval: 28.6–68.6) and the highest prevalence of elder abuse was related to the care neglect dimensionat the prevalence rate of 38.4% (with 95% confidence interval: 21.7–51.6) and the lowest prevalence rate of elder abuse was related to the rejection atthe prevalence rate of 11% (with 95% confidence interval: 6.9–17.1).
Conclusion
The prevalence of elder abuse among elders was high in Iran. Considering the growing elderly population in Iran, preventive measures should be considered in this regard. For this reason, community health nurses are required to provide the elderly, family and community with necessary preventive interventions in this regard.",

Since 2015, the local executive administration is obliged to establish a Seniors Council if there is local demand for such a council. The influence of senior councils is likely to grow over the coming years, given the ageing of the population and the related increasing importance of older citizens in the electorate, especially for local political leaders. Seniors Councils can support better informed local decision-making by helping to identify local needs and contributing to a better allocation of scarce resources.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for periodontitis for over 40 years and novel evidence suggests that periodontitis has an impact on glycemic control in patients with diabetes. This study aimed to compare oral health complications in diabetic older patients from Brazil and France.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 120 patients aged 65 and over diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Sixty patients were admitted to a center for diabetes and hypertension care in Brazil and 60 patients were admitted to the Rouen University hospital. Dental conditions were assessed through the decayed, missing and filled teeth index and periodontal condition was assessed using the Community Periodontal Index. The significance threshold was p < 0.05.
Results
Decayed teeth differed statistically between the groups (p = 0.001). The French group presented more tooth mobility, gingival recession and furcation involvement (p < 0.001). Tooth brushing frequency differed significantly between the groups (p < 0.030). The main cause of missing teeth was periodontitis in the French group and caries and periodontitis in the Brazilian group (p < 0.001). Statistical significance was found for use of fixed upper (p = 0.013) and lower (p = 0.013) dentures in the French group. The French group needed upper denture rehabilitation (p = 0.010) while the Brazilian group needed lower denture rehabilitation (p = 0.003).
Conclusion
Edentulism was prevalent in diabetic older people in both countries. However, the French participants presented with better oral health.",

abstract = "Although the population of older people in Africa is increasing, and older people are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to urbanisation, breakdown of family structures and rising healthcare costs, most African countries have no social health protection for older people. Two exceptions include Senegal's Plan Sesame, a user fees exemption for older people and Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) where older people are exempt from paying premiums. Evidence on whether older people are aware of and enrolling in these schemes is however lacking. We aim to fill this gap. Besides exploring economic indicators, we also investigate whether social exclusion determines enrolment of older people. This is the first study that tries to explore the social, political, economic and cultural (SPEC) dimensions of social exclusion in the context of social health protection programs for older people. Data were collected by two cross-sectional household surveys conducted in Ghana and Senegal in 2012. We develop SPEC indices and conduct logistic regressions to study the determinants of enrolment. Our results indicate that older people vulnerable to social exclusion in all SPEC dimensions are less likely to enrol in Plan Sesame and those that are vulnerable in the political dimension are less likely to enrol in NHIS. Efforts should be taken to specifically enrol older people in rural areas, ethnic minorities, women and those isolated due to a lack of social support. Consideration should also be paid to modify scheme features such as eliminating the registration fee for older people in NHIS and creating administration offices for ID cards in remote communities in Senegal.",

Polypharmacy is associated with inappropriate medication use, and subsequently increasing older persons’ risk of drug-related harm and health-related costs to individuals and society.
Objective
To examine and describe, using a national sample of patient-level medication data, the prevalence of older people's polypharmacy and medication use across dependency levels. To examine oral and general pain prevalence and associated analgesic usage.
Methods
Medication data from the 2012 New Zealand Older People's Oral Health Survey, a nationally-representative, cross-sectional study of dependent older people's oral health, were analysed descriptively, comparing classes and sub-classes of drugs and nutrient supplements taken across four categories of dependency: very low (own homes receiving in-home support), low, high and psychogeriatric (all receiving aged residential care). Self-reported current general pain and frequency of orofacial pain data were cross-tabulated by sub-classes of analgesics taken.
Results
All participants were taking at least one medication overall, 53.2% (95% CI: 50.4, 56.0) took between five and nine (polypharmacy), and 13.9% (95% CI: 17.4, 22.5) took 10 or more (hyperpolypharmacy). Antihypertensives, analgesics, antiulcer drugs, aspirin, laxatives, statins and antidepressants were the most common drug classes taken, the proportions differing between psychogeriatric level care and all other dependency groups. Overall, simple analgesics were taken (34.5%; 95%CI: 30.8, 38.4) more commonly than other analgesics; the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was low (3.6%; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.7). Of those reporting experiencing extreme general bodily pain, 63.3% (95% CI: 56.6, 69.4) took an analgesic, more than those experiencing mouth pain occasionally or often. Fat-soluble vitamins were the most common vitamin supplement taken (32.0%; 95%CI: 27.0, 37.4).
Conclusions
Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy are common among older people, regardless of dependency level, and pain may be undertreated.",

Population ageing has become a public health issue as it is associated with increased morbidity, institutionalization and death. These may directly affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of older people.
Purpose
The aim of the study was to investigate HRQOL and its associated factors among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district, Sri Lanka.
Method
This cross-sectional survey involved 1300 older people. The Euro 5D-3L, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, body mass index, handgrip strength were used to measure HRQOL, physical activity and nutritional status of older people respectively. Factors associated with health-related quality of life were identified through complex sample logistic regression analysis.
Results
Majority of older people (81.9%) reported poor health-related quality of life. Middle old (aOR: 12.06, 95% CI: 5.76, 25.23), very old (aOR: 174.74, 95% CI: 39.74, 768.38), vegetarian diets (aOR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.96), under-nutrition (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.65, 7.04) and over-nutrition (aOR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.28) were significantly associated with poor HRQOL. Using dentures (aOR: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.90) was found as a protective factor for poor HRQOL.
Conclusions
HRQOL was poor among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district. Nutrition-related factors need to be further investigated to improve HRQOL among older people.",

Data was analysed using conditional logit models for sub-groups of participants with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (N = 52) and without cognitive impairment (N = 74), and for the entire study sample using a heteroscedastic conditional logit regression model allowing for scale heterogeneity. The Swait-Louviere test was undertaken to formally test for differences in preference and scale between the two groups. Cognitive impairment was not significant in the scale function of the heteroscedastic conditional logit model (beta = −0.403, SE 0.341 p = 0.237). There were no statistical differences in estimated vector of preference parameters based on the presence or absence of cognitive impairment (Chi-squared = 13, 25 df, p = 0.976). Although there was evidence of a small increase in response variability with increasing cognitive impairment this did not reach statistical significance, and we were able to combine responses for people with and without cognitive impairment.

Elder abuse in recent times has reached a remarkable international importance. This complex phenomenon is still little understood and studied in Italy. The aim of this study was to explore Italian healthcare professionals’ attitude and barriers toward elder abuse, with a glimpse on the current scenario and evidences to develop an action plan.
Materials and methods
42 healthcare professionals filled a questionnaire with 13 open-ended questions, analyzed with a qualitative content analysis. Data were grouped under the following 4 core-themes: description of elder abuse, abuse detection and perception, barriers to reporting, and professional orientation and approach; then they were analyzed to find their central component and discussed jointly.
Results
The respondents described physical (64%) and psychological (50%) abuse and neglect (50%) as the three main characteristics of elder abuse; the 59% of them reported at least one experience in detecting or suspecting elder abuse. The 76% of participants believed the report has to be submitted to the Judicial Authority only in presence of compelling evidences. Furthermore, the 73% of the sample perceived that healthcare professionals are the main figures who have to cope with elder abuse, however they did not feel as their exclusive role the assessment of the patients’ potential abuse.
Conclusion
Knowledge about elder abuse was limited to physical/psychological issues and, moreover, the legal obligation to report was only poorly known. Imperative is the creation of specific education and training courses, in addition to the need for a multidisciplinary and empathetic approach.",

abstract = "Purpose
This paper describes proposed health care services innovations, provided by a system called CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisted Living eXperiment). CAALYX aimed to provide healthcare innovation by extending the state-of-the-art in tele-healthcare, by focusing on increasing the confidence of elderly people living autonomously, by building on the knowledge base of the most common disorders and respective characteristic vital sign changes for this age group.
Methods
A review of the state-of-the-art on health care services was carried out. Then, extensive research was conducted on the particular needs of the elderly in relation to home health services that, if offered to them, could improve their day life by giving them greater confidence and autonomy. To achieve this, we addressed issues associated with the gathering of clinical data and interpretation of these data, as well as possibilities of automatically triggering appropriate clinical measures. Considering this initial work we started the identification of initiatives, ongoing works and technologies that could be used for the development of the system. After that, the implementation of CAALYX was done.
Findings
The innovation in CAALYX system considers three main areas of contribution: (i) The Roaming Monitoring System that is used to collect information on the well-being of the elderly users; (ii) The Home Monitoring System that is aimed at helping the elders independently living at home being implemented by a device (a personal computer or a set top box) that supports the connection of sensors and video cameras that may be used for monitoring and for interaction with the elder; (iii) The Central Care Service and Monitoring System that is implemented by a Caretaker System where attention and care services are provided to elders, where actors as Caretakers, Doctors and Relatives are logically linked to elders. Innovations in each of these areas are presented here.
Conclusions
The ageing European society is placing an added burden on future generations, as the ‘elderly-to-working-age-people’ ratio is set to steadily increase in the future. Nowadays, quality of life and fitness allows for most older persons to have an active life well into their eighties. Furthermore, many older persons prefer to live in their own house and choose their own lifestyle. The CAALYX system can have a clear impact in increasing older persons’ autonomy, by ensuring that they do not need to leave their preferred environment in order to be properly monitored and taken care of.",

abstract = "Objectives
To identify, critically appraise and synthesize qualitative evidence of self-care experiences in health promotion for home-dwelling elders.
Design
A meta-synthesis was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines and using Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument Software.
Data sources
The literature search was conducted on PubMed, CINHAL, Embase, PsycInfo, Eric and ILISI databases from inception up until March 2015. Other articles were searched on Scopus and Web of Knowledge. The reference list of all the identified articles was also searched for additional studies. Studies published in English, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were considered for inclusion in the review.
Review methods
Data from the selected qualitative articles were extracted independently by two reviewers using the data extraction tool of the Joanna Briggs Institute-Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. The meta-synthesis involved the following three steps: the production of a set of statements representing the aggregated data obtained by assembling the findings of qualitative studies; the categorization of findings on the basis of similarity in meaning; and the aggregation of these categories to produce a comprehensive set of synthesized findings. No studies were excluded due to methodological quality.
Results
Of the 4001 records identified, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most articles were conducted in Scandinavian countries and used a phenomenological design. Most elders in the sample were middle-class, cognitively intact, independent, and in good health. The meta-synthesis revealed that older people living at home make decisions about their self-care activities on the basis of their attitudes toward their life and future. These self-care activities are directed toward holistic wellness, prevention and treatment of aging effects, obtaining a sense of satisfaction, and self-realization. Furthermore, self-care activities are settled in a social and relational network that allows old people to take care of themselves and of others or to be cared for by others.
Conclusions
This meta-synthesis presents the perspectives of home-dwelling old people on health-promoting self-care experiences. Such information can help healthcare professionals to maintain long-term autonomy of elders in self-care and to promote healthy aging. Further qualitative research describing self-care experiences of home-dwelling elders from different cultures, education levels, and social backgrounds is needed.",

The results show that while the majority of respondents reported being in good health, many lived in dwellings with minimal shading and no wall insulation and appeared to rely on the use of heaters and coolers to achieve thermally comfortable conditions. Concerns over the cost of heating and cooling were shared among the majority of respondents and particularly among people with low incomes. Findings from this study highlight the importance of providing information to older people, carers, designers and policy makers about the interrelationships between weather, housing design, heating and cooling behaviours, thermal comfort, energy use and health and well-being, in order to support older people to age in place independently and healthily.",

abstract = "Background and purpose
There has been much discussion about the risk factors for osteoporosis, but studies involving elderly population in Taiwan are minimal. We aimed to describe variables related to osteoporosis among community dwelling older people in Taiwan.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study. The 671 participants were randomly selected from 3680 examinees of the annual Senior Citizens Health Examination in year 2010. Participants were interviewed with a detailed questionnaire, and 91 of them were invited for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Predictor variables included age, gender and clinical risk factors for osteoporosis. The main outcome was osteoporosis confirmed by DXA.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 75.7±6.4years old. Overall, the most prevalent variables for osteoporosis were height loss in adulthood (41.0%), lack of dairy products or calcium supplements (32.0%) and insufficient physical activity (10.4%). In multivariate models, we found that underweight (OR=9.80) and lack of dairy products/calcium supplements (OR=3.68) were the main variables for osteoporosis. In the subgroup analysis involving only women, underweight (OR=14.60) was the main variable.
Discussion
Among community-dwelling older people in Taiwan, osteoporosis was mainly associated with underweight and lack of dairy products or calcium supplements.
Conclusion
We suggest using the key questions of underweight and dietary pattern in clinical settings to identify high risk people who are candidates for further BMD exam.",

Results
A majority of Japanese elders (79%) agreed with unified guidance in combination with the issue of health insurance cards at age 65 or 75. The most preferred method for receiving information was video presentation.
Conclusions
Japanese elders appear to welcome the idea of receiving information about AD when they are issued health insurance cards at age 65 or 75. Use of video materials holds great promise for educating elderly Japanese about their choices on AD.",

Methods
This is a descriptive correlational study that was conducted in Pekanbaru. This study involved 85 elders that were recruited using purposive sampling technique. Data were obtained by using questionnaires.
Results
Descriptive analysis using a computer software showed that 96.5% of elderly were Muslim, 48.2% were from Minang tribe, 55.3% were female, 56.5% were married, 78.8% were low-educated, 83.5% were unemployed, and 84.7% had experience of losing a spouse, and showed that 56.5% of elderly have high psychosocial wellbeing state, which reflected psychological health and the ability to interact socially. Of all sociodemographic characteristics of the elders, all indicated higher psychosocial wellbeing state except for single elders or don’t have a life partner and unemployed elders. Chi-square test showed no significant relationship between educational level, marital status, employment status, and bereavement experience with psychosocial wellbeing of the elders (p>0.05).

abstract = "Purpose
To explore the combined effect of trends in older people on their future healthcare utilisation.
Methods
A Delphi study consisting of two rounds was conducted. The heterogeneous expert panel (n = 16) in the field of elderly care rated the effect of combinations of trends in the Netherlands on the use of seven healthcare services: i.e. informal, home, general practitioner, acute, specialist, nursing home and mental health care. The percentage and direction of the overall consensus, for the different health services, and for three main trends were analysed.
Results
Experts reached consensus in 57 of 92 ratings (62%). Taking into account the interaction between trends, they expected an extra increase for informal, home, and general practitioner care, but no additional effect of interaction for specialist and acute care. Combinations that included trends leading to less support were expected to lead to an extra increase in utilisation.
Conclusions
Experts expect that interaction between trends will lead to an extra increase in the use of general practitioner, home, and informal care. This increase is mainly the result of interaction with trends leading to less support for older persons. The present results show the need to take the effect of interaction into account when designing new health policy and in research on future healthcare utilisation.",

Twenty community-dwelling people of advanced age (85+) were recruited in 2015–16 from a large multidisciplinary longitudinal study of advanced age. These twenty participated in interviews about health in advanced age, impact of illnesses, interactions with clinicians, access to information, support for managing health, and perceptions of primary care, medications, and other forms of assistance. We use a positioning theory framework drawing on thematic and narrative analysis to understand the dynamic ways people in advanced age position themselves and the ways they age well through speech acts and storylines. People in advanced age saw themselves as challenged, rather than threatened, by adversities, and positioned themselves as able to draw on a lifetime of experience and resourcefulness and collaborations with supporters to deal with challenges. Key strategies include downplaying illness and resisting biomedical discourses of complexity, positioning embodied selves as having agency, and creative adaptation in the face of loss. People in advanced age exhibit resilience, maintaining wellbeing, autonomy and good physical and mental quality of life even while living with challenges such as functional decline and multi-morbidities. These findings have significance for supporters of older people, emphasising the need to move away from a narrow focus on problems to working together WITH people in advanced age to offer a more holistic approach that encourages and enhances adaptation and flexibility, rather than rigid and counterproductive coping patterns.",

abstract = "Background
Although frailty of older people has been shown to be associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, evidence on healthcare costs associated with frailty is scarce.
Methods
Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and AMED were electronically searched in January 2019 based on a protocol in accordance with the PRISMA statement using Medical Subjective Heading and free text terms, with explosion functions. Language restriction was not applied. Studies were considered if they were published between 2000 to January 2019 and provided healthcare costs stratified by the frailty status categories among community-dwelling older people with a mean age of 60 years or higher. Reference lists of the included studies were reviewed for additional studies. Healthcare costs according to frailty status were compared using standardized mean difference random-effects meta-analysis.
Results
The systematic review found 3116 citations. After screening for title, abstract, and full-text for eligibility, 5 studies involving 3742362 participants were included. Healthcare costs were compared across three frailty status, robust, prefrailty, and frailty. Both prefrailty (5 studies, Hedges’ g = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.33, p < 0.001) and frailty (5 studies, Hedges’ g = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.61-0.62, p < 0.001) were associated with significantly higher healthcare costs when compared with robustness. There was a high degree of heterogeneity. The risk of publication bias was considered to be low in funnel plots.
Conclusions
This systematic review and meta-analysis found a dose-response increase in the healthcare costs associated with frailty among community-dwelling older adults. Future research should recognize frailty as an important factor associated with increased healthcare costs.",

However understanding of the experience and challenges of living and dying with frailty in older age is currently undeveloped. Frailty is often used as a synonym for the increasing infirmities that accompany ageing and the slow dwindling dying trajectory of many elders. However, there is little empirical work on the experience of being frail to inform social gerontological perspectives and welfare provision. Through analysis of repeated in-depth interviews over 17 months (2006–2008) with 17 frail elders living at home in the U.K., key factors that shape elders’ experience of being frail emerged. The study argues that the visible markers of functional limitations and the increasing social losses of old age bring finitude to the fore. To retain anchorage in this state of imbalance, frail elders work actively to develop and sustain connections to their physical environment, routines and social networks. This experience can be conceptualised as persistent liminality; a state of imbalance “betwixt and between” active living and clinically recognised dying. This paper highlights the precarious and often protracted dying trajectory of frail older people. Whilst it could be argued that developing into death in older age is part of a normal and successful course after a life long-lived, recognition of and support for older people deemed frail is lacking. Frail elders find themselves living in the margin between the Third and Fourth Age with little recognition of or support for the work of living and dying over time. This experience of frailty contests dominant cultural and welfare practices and policy frameworks that operate in binary modes: social or health; independent or dependent; living or dying.",

Care homes provide personal care and support for older people who can no longer be supported in the community. As part of a larger study of integrated working between the NHS and care homes we asked older people how they accessed health care services. Our aim was to understand how older people resident in care homes access health services using the Andersen model of health care access.
Methods
Case studies were conducted in six care homes with different socio-economic characteristics, size and ownership in three study sites. Residents in all care homes with capacity to participate were eligible for the study. Interviews explored how residents accessed NHS professionals. The Andersen model of health seeking behaviour was our analytic framework.
Findings
Thirty-five participants were interviewed with an average of 4 different conditions. Expectations of their health and the effectiveness of services to mitigate their problems were low. Enabling factors were the use of intermediaries (usually staff, but also relatives) to seek access. Residents expected that care home staff would monitor changes in their health and seek appropriate help unprompted.
Conclusions
Care home residents may normalise their health care needs and frame services as unable to remediate these which may combine to disincline older care home residents to seek care. Care access was enabled using intermediaries -either staff or relatives-and the expectation that staff would proactively seek care when they observed new/changed needs. Residents may over-estimate the health-related knowledge of care home staff and their ability to initiate referrals to NHS professionals.",

The overall prevalence of depression was 44.4%. Urban residence, insomnia, being a woman, life stressors, disturbed marital life, dependent old adults and absence of religiosity are the main independent predictors of depression among elder people.
Conclusions
This study provide an alarming signal for health professionals and health policy maker in Egypt for the need of a better recognition of depressive symptoms in elderly.",

Our aim was to analyze the effect of HPA-axis functioning as a mediator in the relationship between loneliness and cognitive function, and interactions depending on sex, in healthy older people. To do so, 86 healthy older people (52.3% female) from 60 to 80 years old (M = 67.44, SD = 4.37) completed the revised UCLA loneliness scale. A neuropsychological battery was administered to assess global cognition, processing speed, attention and executive function, working memory, and verbal memory immediate and delayed recall. Saliva samples were provided on two consecutive weekdays to obtain awakening and bedtime cortisol levels, the diurnal cortisol slope (DCS), and the area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg). Our results showed that loneliness was not directly associated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, loneliness was related to higher bedtime cortisol levels, but not to awakening cortisol, the DCS, or the AUCg. In addition, loneliness was associated with worse performance on attention and processing speed, executive function, and verbal memory immediate recall, via bedtime cortisol levels. Therefore, we suggest that HPA-axis functioning is one of the biological mechanisms that mediate the relationship between loneliness and poorer cognitive function. No sex differences were observed in these associations.",

Suicide in older people is a public health concern. Emergency nurses are ideally placed to identify suicide risk. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore emergency nurses’ knowledge, confidence and attitudes about suicide in older people.
Methods
This descriptive exploratory study was conducted in four emergency departments in Sydney, Australia. Data were collected using a 28-item survey from a convenience sample of emergency nurses. Descriptive quantitative statistics and conventional content analysis were performed. Ethics approval was provided.
Results
The response rate was 58% (n = 136); the majority were female with an average of seven years emergency experience. The majority (n = 124, 91%) reported that they frequently managed suicidal behaviour and recognized suicide as a common event (80%). 51% (n = 69) recognized that suicide was a common event for older people. Only 16% (n = 22) reported receiving suicide prevention training with 11% feeling confident in managing suicidal behaviour.
Conclusion
The findings contribute to the discourse on how suicide in older people is recognised by emergency nurses. Few nurses considered it a problem for older people and were not confident about their knowledge. There is a need for suicide prevention training as a priority particularly to identify risks in older people.",

Direct involvement in creative activities can have benefits in terms of improved attention and positive engagement for older people. We used the social return on investment (SROI) approach to explore the social and economic benefits of arts activities for older people living in residential homes in England.
Methods
We complied with the CHEERS checklist and followed the six stages of SROI as reported in the literature.
Results
We identified three main stakeholders: care home residents, care home personnel, and activity co-ordinators. For residents, the outcomes of interest were: community inclusion, mental and physical health, improved cognition and decreased social isolation. For care home personnel and activity co-ordinators the outcomes were: improved skills in caring for older people and increased confidence in using arts interventions. The analysis yielded an SROI of £1.20 for every £1 of expenditure. The sensitivity analysis revealed that when we consider a displacement rate of 15% for all the outcomes of all participating stakeholders, the Imagine study is unlikely to report a ratio that is less than £1.02 for every £1.00 invested.
Conclusions
Findings could inform policy decisions about investment in the arts and health or social care.",

Results
Analysis noted increasing trends in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity from 1996 to 2015. Decreasing trends were noted in the prevalence of current smokers and drinkers over this 20-year period, whereas health service utilisation increased with age in all surveys. In 2015, both inpatient and outpatient care are significantly associated with increasing age and diabetes.
Conclusions
Increasing trends of health problems and healthcare utilisation were observed among older people in Malaysia. Policymakers should plan for appropriate resources to meet the challenges of an ageing population in Malaysia.",

abstract = "Background
Person-centred care is widely accepted in health policy as a central focus for health services. However, research studies indicate that, for nurses, the person-centred care of older people with cognitive impairment is challenging.
Aim
This study aimed to compare levels of person-centred care between wards and professional groups (ENs and RNs) providing tertiary hospital care of older people with cognitive impairment.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional survey design, using the 15-item Person-centredness of Older People with cognitive impairment in Acute Care (POPAC) survey instrument, was undertaken.
Results
Nurses working in hospital wards of a tertiary-level health service (n=240; RR=54.3%) responded. Person-centred care was rated lower in wards with higher patient turnover compared to wards with lower patient turnover. Person-centred care was rated higher by enrolled nurses compared to registered nurses.
Discussion
Hospital context, specifically high turnover wards, present a threat to person-centred care, possibly related to the limited time available to undertake the personal care and associated conversations that can enhance nurses’ knowledge of the person. ENs carry more responsibility for these tasks, possibly explaining the variability in person-centred scores between RNs and ENs. In comparison to other studies, nurses in this study had higher average scores for person-centred care, raising measurement as an important challenge in monitoring the implementation of person-centred care policy.
Conclusion
The focus on health service efficiency appears to pose a threat to nurses’ delivery of person-centred care. Further research into the variability between person-centred care of RNs and ENs, and investigation into the practices of other health disciplines would be valuable. Given the importance of person-centred care to the safety and quality of health services, the POPAC addresses the challenge of monitoring person-centred policy initiatives. However, self-report instruments should be balanced with other sources of information about practice.",

This study aims to determine the impact of grandchild care provision on elders’ mental health by self-comparison and longitudinal study design.
Method
Information of 2930 grandparents from the Study of Health and Living Status of the Middle-Aged and Elderly in Taiwan were analysed. Elders’ mental health was evaluated by Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale in both 2003 and 2007. Participants were divided into 4 groups based on their changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren from 2003 to 2007. Chi-square test was used to compare changes in elders’ individual characteristics and total CESD scores between and within groups. ANOVA was used to compare the means of elders’ depressive symptoms between groups while paired-t test was used to compare changes in elders’ depression symptoms from 2003 to 2007. Logistic regression was performed to determine the associations between elders' changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren and changes in depressive symptoms.
Results
Elders continuously caring for grandchildren or started to take care of grandchildren significantly felt happier and enjoyed life more than before and more than elders who do not provide grandchild care. Logistic regression analyses exploring the impact of grandchild care provision found that elders provided no grandchild care had worst mental health amongst all. Elders stopped providing grandchild care had significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms (OR=1.40) than elders provided no grandchild care at all time.
Discussion
By self-comparison, this study illustrates how taking care of grandchildren maintains elders’ mental health, especially against them from loneliness and depression.",

The aim of this article was to synthesize research findings about health care providers’ experiences of patient-centered care in the home setting.
Methods
This is a meta-synthesis of qualitative findings using the analytical method of meta-ethnography developed by Noblit and Hare. We performed a systematic literature search in seven databases and assessed potential studies against eligibility criteria and quality. Subsequently, 10 primary studies were included for analysis.
Results
The core theme “being a balance artist” emerged from the synthesis, incorporating the participants’ experiences when faced with conflicting and competing responsibilities and needs. Two subthemes—“balancing the older clients’ needs against organizational demands” and “balancing the older clients’ needs against professional standards”—further elaborated on this core theme.
Conclusion
Health care providers’ experiences indicate that organizational factors play a crucial role in shaping the conditions for patient-centered care for older people in the home setting.
Practice implications
To motivate and facilitate health care providers to move to a more patient-centered practice, it is important to expand the values of patient-centered care beyond the clinical encounter into the organization.",

Existing evidence on long-term psychotropic polypharmacy in older people is scarce despite serious safety concerns regarding this issue. This study aims to identify distinct trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use and to examine the association with the risk of mortality and unplanned hospitalization according to distinct trajectories.
Design
A retrospective longitudinal cohort study based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).
Setting and participants
A population-based study including 39,803 eligible participants aged 65 years or older who were newly prescribed oral psychotropic agents in 2004.
Measures
We assessed 5 years of monthly consumption of psychotropic agents among eligible participants and used group-based trajectory modeling to identify distinct groups of longitudinal psychotropic use. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between distinct trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use and subsequent 1- and 3-year unplanned hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
Results
Among 39,803 eligible participants, we identified 5 trajectories of longitudinal psychotropic agent use over a 5-year follow-up period: sustained intense (7.1%), moderate increasing (12.1%), decreasing (13.4%), slowly increasing (15.7%), and infrequent users (51.6%). Moderate increasing and sustained intense use were associated with significantly higher risks of unplanned hospitalization [moderate increasing use: hazard ratio [HR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.44; sustained intense use: HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.58] and all-cause mortality (moderate increasing use: HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09-1.44; sustained intense use: HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12-1.56) than infrequent use. Similar results were observed at 3 years of follow-up.
Conclusions/Implications
Older people with moderately increasing and sustained intense use of psychotropic agents over time had higher risks of unplanned hospitalization and mortality. Tracking older people's use of psychotropic agents over time may help to identify individuals at greatest risk of unplanned hospitalization and mortality.",

In this pilot study, six transcribed consultations between nurse assistants and older people in home health care were analysed using a coding system for positive emotions with seven categories capturing both content and emotional intensity of positive affect.
Results
We found 114 expressions of positive emotions, 63% from nurse assistants and 37% from patients. Patients mostly expressed gratitude, indicating that patients are grateful for being helped. Nurse assistants mostly expressed Praise or Support, indicating that they gave their patients positive affirmation.
Conclusion
The praise and support given by nurse assistants to older people in home health care seemed effective in fostering relationships and maintaining patient resilience. Thus, we claim that emotional talk in communication also should include positive emotions.
Practice Implication
Teaching health care providers about the importance of expressions of positive emotions should be integrated in communication skills training.",

The burden of unrelieved pain experienced by older people and its associated high symptom and economic costs demands consideration of new strategies to better this condition. As the global uptake of digital technology increases, exploring its potential to impact positively on older peoples’ pain self-management practices warrants investigation. This integrative review aimed to evaluate the use of digital health technology for management of older people’s pain across care-settings. Searches were conducted to identify relevant English language studies published in CINHAL, Medline, Academic Search Complete, EMBASE, Cochrane library databases, and Google and Google Scholar websites. A total of 1003 papers were identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by three Phase II randomized controlled trials. These trials demonstrated the feasibility of computer based interactive or instructive video interventions however there was limited evidence to support their use for reduction of pain intensity and interference. Qualitative evidence demonstrated older people’s willingness to use mobile technologies (iPhone or digital pen) to help manage their pain, however, the need of device-use training and connectedness with clinicians were highlighted. In conclusion, there is some evidence that integrating digital health technology into older peoples’ pain self-management plan is feasible and acceptable. However, the provision of high-quality technological interventions informed by a thorough understanding of older people’s digital technology pain management needs is required to ensure greater integration of this technology in clinical practice.",

Despite increasing the efforts in increasing awareness about the benefits of PPE among the farm workers, a vast majority of the farm workers including pickers don't use the PPE. The present study examines health impacts of cotton harvesting in Pakistani Punjab along with the factors affecting the use of PPE among the cotton pickers. Cross-sectional data collected from Vehari district is used. The study estimates health cost and the use of PPE among the young and elder cotton pickers. Headache, sleeplessness, cough, flue/fever, skin and eyes problems are reported by the young and elder cotton pickers. Personal protective equipment is rarely used during picking. However, the young pickers relatively adopt more PPE compared to the elder cotton pickers. Health cost of cotton picking is US$2.96 and 3.06 per season during the year for the young and elder cotton pickers, respectively. Results of logit model show that health cost, age, education below 8th grade, perception of temporary impact and health problems are important determinants of adopting PPE among the cotton pickers. The findings of the study conclude that the use of PPE can be realized through proper training and education of cotton pickers and farm workers.",

Emergency department presentations by older people associated with mental health and drug and alcohol related conditions are increasing. However, the characteristics of presentations by older people in Australia are largely unknown. The aim of this research was to explore the characteristics of older people presenting with mental health and drug and alcohol conditions.
Procedures
We used a retrospective electronic medical record audit to explore all emergency department presentations by older people 65 years and over for mental health and drug and alcohol related conditions over a 12 month period. Data were described using descriptive statistics.
Finidngs
There were 40,093 presentations; 2% (n=900) were related to mental health or drug and alcohol related conditions. Presentations were mainly associated with primary mental or medical symptoms. The majority were female (n=471; 53%). Predominate conditions were cognitive impairment (n=234; 26%) and affective disorders (n=233; 26.0%). Sixty-three percent of patients were admitted to a hospital ward. Over the study period 106 patients (242 episodes of care) represented.
Principle conclusions
Given the ageing population and increasing prevalence for mental health and drug and alcohol conditions, strategies are required to better recognise these conditions to reduce the burden on the health care system and improve health for older people.",

Older people can experience swallowing difficulties because of co-morbidities, age-related physiological changes, and polypharmacy. To make medicines easier to swallow, many people will modify the medication dosage form e.g. split or crush tablets, and open capsules. Some of the challenges associated with administering medicines to older people, and issues with dosage form modification will be reviewed. Novel dosage forms in development are promising and may help overcome some of the issues. However, until these are more readily available, effective interdisciplinary teams, and improving patient health literacy will help reduce the risk of medication misadventures in older people.",

Falls are the most common cause of serious injuries and are a major health threat in the stratum of older population. Early detection of a fall is a key factor when trying to provide adequate care to elderly person who has suffered an accident at home. Therefore, the detection of falls in the elderly remains a major challenge in the field of public health. Specific actions aimed at the fall detection can provide urgent care which allows, on the other hand, drastically reduce the cost of medical care, and improve primary care service. In this paper, we present a support system for detecting falls of an elder person by the combination of a wearable wireless sensor node based on an accelerometer and a static wireless non-intrusive sensory infrastructure based on heterogeneous sensor nodes. This previous infrastructure called DIA (Dispositivo Inteligente de Alarma, in Spanish) is an AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) system that allows to infer a potential fall. This inference is reinforced for prompt attention by a specific sensorisation at portable node sensor in order to help distinguish between falls and daily activities of assisted person. The wearable node will not determine a falling situation, it will advice the reasoner layer about specific acceleration patterns that could, eventually, imply a falling. Is at the higher layer where the falling is determined from the whole context produced by mesh of fixed nodes. Experimental results have shown that the proposed system obtains high reliability and sensitivity in the detection of the fall.",

Medication adherence is a key factor of the therapy of chronic diseases in older people with chronic diseases. Inadequate health literacy results in poor health outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of health literacy on medication adherence to provide information for improving health outcomes in older people with chronic disease. This was a cross-sectional study of older people (people aged over 65 years) with chronic diseases in Korea taking one or more medications for 6 months and over from an academic referral medical center. Each patient completed a structured questionnaire by interview or self-report. Of the 291 older participants, 30.6% had high medication adherence. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis, health literacy was the strongest predictor of medication adherence (β=0.190, P=0.001). In addition, perceived health status, use of magnifying glass, and assistance with medication administration were also significant factors related to medication adherence. In conclusion, enhancing health literacy may improve medication adherence of older people with chronic disease. The development, implementation and evaluation of health literacy interventions for older people with chronic conditions are important to increase medication adherence and potentially improve patient outcomes. Such programs would also raise awareness of the impact of health literacy on patient outcomes. Furthermore, this could contribute to reducing health inequalities worldwide.",

The purpose of the study was to explore experiences of older people with cancer in ascertaining the attributes of a person-centred approach in sustaining hope and enabling human flourishing. This was a qualitative study comparing patients and professional experiences and perceptions of care across to ward settings.
Methods
Methods involved 10 semi-structured interviews conducted with patients and focus groups (n = 6) and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals. Three dissemination focus groups (n = 14) were also carried out with professionals to allow further analysis of the data.
Results
Two main themes were identified, including ‘Emotional adaptations of hope: wants and expectations’ and ‘Hope through belittling their illness’. Findings highlight the way hope is conveyed and the emphasis' accorded to issues such as societal perceptions, knowledge, expectations of care, life stage, relationships, identity, and emotions. Findings also reinforce the importance of maintaining hope, recognising the different ways hope is used, and enabling patients to flourish.
Conclusion
This study highlights how hope is facilitated through the interaction between patients and professionals and that the relational interactive stance. This current study establishes that hope seemed to be temporal, contextual and dynamic in nature, involving an ongoing process. Helping older people with cancer to understand their illness considering the situation of lives and experiences is essential to address expectations and wants.",

abstract = "This ‘10 Questions’ contribution provides an overview of thermal comfort in relation to ageing and the way the indoor environment can contribute to and improve well-being and health of older adults to age-in-place. The number of older people is increasing rapidly and these demographical changes put a large stress on the health care system. Furthermore, as most older people wish to age-in-place, adequate ageing-in-place strategies become significantly important. Housing impacts health, therefore appropriate and comfortable housing is a key determinant to facilitate older people to age-in-place. One of the aspects of concern is thermal comfort; however, the thermal requirements of older people differ from those of young adults. They are also relatively vulnerable to thermal conditions outside the generally accepted range. This ’10 Questions' contribution addresses issues related to thermal comfort and ageing and argues that the current models for assessing thermal comfort are not sufficiently accurate to be used for older adults. It also discusses approaches to facilitate ageing-in-place including the use of smart home technologies. The paper is based on extensive literature review of numerous relevant studies relating to thermal comfort, physiological differences between older and younger people, the relationship between thermal environment, comfort and health, as well as housing design and smart home technologies for older people.",

As transport patterns, including car ownership and public transport, vary between countries; we focused our review on studies undertaken in the UK. We searched for studies in English language journals using health, social science, age- and transport-related databases, supplementing the searches with advice from researchers in the field. Ten studies, reported in 12 papers, met the inclusion criteria. The data, consisting of participant accounts and author interpretations, were analysed using thematic synthesis, an iterative process that moves from data-coding to descriptive themes and then to cross-cutting analytical themes. From this, three analytical themes were identified and refined through feedback from policy advisors. The first theme related to the experience of living with an inadequate transport system. The second and third themes highlighted the practical importance of everyday travel in enabling older people to maintain their lives and its symbolic importance in affirming valued identities. While everyday travel – on foot, by public and community transport and by car – facilitated access to health-related goods and services (for example, food shops and health services), it is its broader contribution to quality of life in older age that our review highlights.",

abstract = "Background
Prevention of problematic alcohol use is mainly focused on younger adults, while heavy drinking in middle-aged and older adults might be more frequent with more impact on functioning and health care use. Therefore, alcohol use and alcohol disorder in both age groups was compared. To facilitate age-specific prevention, it was examined whether risk factors of heavy drinking and impact on functioning and health care use differs across the life-span.
Methods
Data of people (23–70 years) were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (N = 4618), a general population-based cohort. Heavy alcohol use was defined as >14 drinks/week for women and >21 drinks/week for men. Alcohol disorder was defined as DSM-IV disorder of alcohol abuse and/or alcohol dependence. (Multinomial) logistic regression analyses were used to study risk factors of alcohol use and associations between alcohol use and health care use and functioning.
Results
The past-year prevalence of heavy alcohol was higher in older (55–70 years) compared to younger people (6.7% versus 3.8%), whereas alcohol disorder was less prevalent (1.3% versus 3.9%). Heavy alcohol use was associated with higher level of education in older adults compared to younger adults. Other characteristics of problematic alcohol use and its impact on functioning and health care use did not differ between age groups.
Conclusions
Heavy drinking is more prevalent among middle-aged and older people. Contrary to younger adults, prevention of heavy alcohol use in those aged 55–70 should focus on higher educated people.",

This percentage is even lower (9.8%) in urban China. It is, therefore, important to understand the pathways by which physical activity behaviors are impacted by the built environment. This study utilized a mixed methods approach—interviews (n = 42) and longitudinal (2010–2015) health survey data (n = 3094) for older people residing in three neighborhoods in Huainan, a mid-sized city in Anhui Province, central eastern China. First, a content analysis of interview data was used to identify individual and built environment factors (motivators and barriers) that impacted physical activity within older people's activity spaces. Second, a multilevel path analysis was conducted using the health survey data to demonstrate the pathways by which these motivators and barriers contributed to the initiation, regulation, and maintenance of physical activity. This study found (a) that the liveliness of an apartment building and its proximity to functional spaces (fast-food stores, farmer's markets, supermarkets, pharmacies, schools, hospitals, PA facilities and natural and man-made water bodies) were important factors in attracting sedentary older people to initiate physical activity; (b) the social networks of apartment neighbors helped to initiate, regulate, and maintain physical activity; and housing closeness to functional spaces was important in maintaining physical activity, particularly for those older people with chronic diseases. To increase older people's overall physical activity, future interventions should focus on residential form and access to functional spaces, prior to investing in large-scale urban design interventions.",

These have important implications for social protection systems. The goal of this paper is to model future functional disability and healthcare expenditures based on current trends. To project the health, disability and hospitalization spending of future elders, we adapted the Future Elderly Model (FEM) to Singapore. The FEM is a dynamic Markov microsimulation model developed in the US. Our main source of population data was the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) consisting of 63,000 respondents followed up over three waves from 1993 to 2010. The FEM model enables us to investigate the effects of disability compounded over the lifecycle and hospitalization spending, while adjusting for competing risk of multi-comorbidities. Results indicate that by 2050, 1 in 6 elders in Singapore will have at least one ADL disability and 1 in 3 elders will have at least one IADL disability, an increase from 1 in 12 elders and 1 in 5 elders respectively in 2014. The highest prevalence of functional disability will be in those aged 85 years and above. Lifetime hospitalization spending of elders aged 55 and above is US$24,400 (30.2%) higher among people with functional disability compared to those without disability. Policies that successfully tackle diabetes and promote healthy living may reduce or delay the onset of disability, leading to potential saving. In addition, further technological improvements may reduce the financial burden of disability.",

Background
Taiwan is an aging society by the definition of the World Health Organization. The trend of elder population is one of the fastest worldwide. The Taiwan Foundation for Geriatric Emergency and Critical Care dedicates to disseminate health promotion behaviors for community elders and middle age adults. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and satisfaction of the health education programs on health promotion behaviors.
Methods
A one-group pretest-posttest study was conducted using purposively sampling of participants of the health education programs at five community care centers in the great Taipei metropolitan area. A structure questionnaire was developed to collect data. SPSS 20.0 was used in statistical analysis.
Results
Above 40% of 136 participants were either overweight or obesity. Comparing pretest and posttest scores, the changes in mentality, perceived health, physical exercise, and blood pressure measurement were significant (p < 0.05). The overall satisfaction with the health education programs was high (3.62). It was found the correlation between marital status and perceived health was positive (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
The health education programs specifically for elders and middle age adults in community care centers were effective in raising the awareness of health promotion behaviors. The success could provide a reference for future studies developing health promotion and education programs and holistic care for community elders and middle age adults in Taiwan.",

Alzheimer disease (AD) can affect masticatory function, affecting oral health–related quality of life (OHRQoL). Whether oral rehabilitation with conventional removable prostheses can restore masticatory function and improve OHRQoL in these individuals is unknown.
Purpose
The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the influence of oral rehabilitation with removable prostheses on masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL in elders with and without AD.
Material and methods
Thirty-two elders with mild AD (n=16, mean age=76.7 ±6.3 years) or without AD (n=16, mean age=75.2 ±4.4 years) were recruited. All participants first underwent masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL evaluations, and 2 months after insertion of new removable prostheses, the variables were reassessed. Masticatory efficiency was determined using the sieving method, and OHRQoL was measured by applying the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). The data from the baseline and after insertion of the new removable prostheses were compared by paired t test. Group differences at each time point were assessed by t test (α=.05).
Results
After insertion of the new removable prostheses, masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL improved in both the elders with AD and the control. At baseline, elders with AD had lower masticatory efficiency and higher OHRQoL than controls (P<.05). After removable prosthesis insertion, elders with AD continued to show lower masticatory efficiency values than controls, but their OHRQoL was similar.
Conclusions
Oral rehabilitation with new removable prostheses improved the masticatory efficiency and OHRQoL of elders with and without AD, although masticatory efficiency did not reach control levels in elders with AD.",

The prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among older people is high. Screening for CRC presents a cost-effective secondary prevention and control strategy which results in a significant reduction in mortality. This study aims to describe the prevalence of CRC screening and examine its risk factors among Chinese community-dwelling older people guided by a comprehensive model combining Health Belief Model and Extended Parallel Processing Model.
Methods
A descriptive correlational study was conducted. A convenience sample of 240 community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 was recruited in May–July in 2012 in Hong Kong. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire which collected information on demographic variables, CRC-related psychosocial variables and whether they had a CRC screening in the past 10 years.
Results
Among the participants, 25.4% reported having a CRC screening test. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that participants with a higher level in cue to action, and lower perceived knowledge barriers and severity-fear were significantly associated with participation in CRC screening. But there were no significant associations between fatalism and cancer fear with screening.
Conclusions
The prevalence of CRC screening was low in Hong Kong Chinese community-dwelling elders. A number of modifiable factors associated with CRC screening were identified which provides specific targets for interventions. This study also adds to the knowledge regarding the associations between fatalism and fear with CRC screening behaviors among Chinese older people.",

An intervention ‘Better Oral Health in Home Care’ was introduced (2012–2014) to improve the oral health of older people receiving community aged care services. Implementation of the intervention was theoretically framed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Process outcomes demonstrated significant improvements in older people’s oral health.
Objective
To evaluate the extent to which the intervention has been embedded and sustained into routine community aged care practice 3 years after the initial implementation project.
Design
A Realist Evaluation applying Normalisation Process Theory within a single case study setting.
Setting
Community aged care (home care) provider in South Australia, Australia.
Participants
Purposeful sampling was undertaken. Twelve staff members were recruited from corporate, management and direct care positions. Two consumers representing high and low care recipients also participated.
Methods
Qualitative methods were applied in two subcases, reflecting different contextual settings. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and analysed deductively by applying the Normalisation Process Theory core constructs (with the recommended phases of the Realist Evaluation cycle). Retrospective and prospective analytic methods investigated how the intervention has been operationalised by comparing two timeframes: Time 1 (Implementation June 2012–December 2014) and Time 2 (Post-implementation July 2017–July 2018).
Results
At Time 1, the initial program theory proposed that multi-level facilitation contributed to a favourable context that triggered positive mechanisms supportive of building organisational and workforce oral healthcare capacity. At Time 2, an alternative program theory of how the intervention has unfolded in practice described a changed context following the withdrawal of the project facilitation processes with the triggering of alternative mechanisms that have made it difficult for staff to embed sustainable practice.
Conclusion
Findings concur with the literature that successful implementation outcomes do not necessarily guarantee sustainability. The study has provided a deeper explanation of how contextual characteristics have contributed to the conceptualisation of oral healthcare as a low priority, basic work-ready personal care task and how this, in turn, hindered the embedding of sustainable oral healthcare into routine community aged care practice. This understanding can be used to better inform the development of strategies, such as multi-level facilitation, needed to navigate contextual barriers so that sustainable practice can be achieved.",

Participants were assessed at baseline and at six months for physical (general health and health quality of life) and mental (general well-being, anxiety, depression and psychological distress) health. The sample consisted of 92 subjects, 42 in the control group and 50 in the workshop. Compared to controls, subjects in the workshop had significantly lower follow-up levels of anxiety and depression and improved general well-being. No differences were observed for general health, health quality of life, or psychological distress. This humor therapy workshop was associated with a positive effect upon mental health. It is recommended that attendance at humor workshops be encouraged and that further investigations into the efficacy of such programs on mental and physical health be investigated.",

abstract = "Statement of problem
Parkinson disease (PD) symptoms, such as muscle rigidity, tremors in the lips and tongue, and involuntary mandibular movements, may cause oral health-related problems, mastication difficulties, and denture discomfort because of the difficulty in controlling a prosthesis with the oral musculature.
Purpose
The purpose of this observational clinical study was to evaluate the influence of oral rehabilitation with a removable prosthesis on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and masticatory efficiency (ME) in elders with PD.
Material and methods
Thirty-four elders with PD (n=17, mean age 69.4 ±4.7 years) or without PD (n=17, mean age 70.7 ±4.7 years) were recruited. All participants first underwent OHRQoL and ME evaluations. Two months after the insertion of new removable prostheses, the participants were reassessed. The OHRQoL was measured with the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-49). ME was evaluated by determining the percentage weight of the comminuted silicone-based artificial material that passed through a 2.8 mm sieve. For each group, data were compared between baseline and after insertion of new removable prostheses by paired t test or Wilcoxon sign test/signed-rank test. Group differences were assessed at each time point by t test (α=.05).
Results
After the insertion of removable prostheses, elders with PD showed improved OHRQoL and ME. Controls also showed improvements on both measures after insertion of removable prostheses. At baseline, elders with PD had lower OHRQoL and ME compared with the controls (P<.05). After removable prosthesis insertion, the elders with PD continued to show lower ME values than the controls, but their OHRQoL was similar.
Conclusions
Oral rehabilitation with new removable dental prostheses improved the OHRQoL and ME in elders with and without PD, although ME did not reach control levels in elders with PD.",

abstract = "Background
Empty nest has been becoming the main family pattern among old people, and influencing the traditional family providing for the aged in China. This study aimed to investigate the association of empty nest with depressive symptom in a Chinese elderly population.
Methods
Our study was based on the baseline investigation of Zhejiang Major Public Health Surveillance which was conducted in 2014. The final analyzed sample consisted of 9215 participants aged no less than 60 years. Subjects completed a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, living arrangements, behavioral risk factors, health status, subjective assessments, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale.
Results
More than half of the participants were empty nest elders (57.4%). The overall prevalence of depressive symptom was 10.3%, while it was higher in empty nest group than in non-empty nest group (11.6% vs. 8.6%, P<0.001). A positive association was found between empty nest and depressive symptom, the OR (95%CI) was 1.223(1.045, 1.431). After stratified by gender/age/education level/employment status, this association was just prominent in participants of male, 70 years old and above, primary school education, and retirees. No matter living with spouse or living alone, empty nesters were more likely to have depressive symptoms than non-empty nesters.
Limitations
Cross-sectional study could not make a causation conclusion. The social supports of participants were not been investigated in detail.
Conclusions
Empty nest elders, especially those who are male, 70 years old and above, primary school education, and retired, are more vulnerable to depressive symptom.",

In this context, the approach to medicines delivery should seek to overcome some of the difficulties of delivering medicines to older people, and ensure each medication is delivered by the optimal and most convenient route for the patient in question. However, this poses significant obstacles, as the development of medicines suitable for use in older populations does not often account for complex health needs, potential challenges in relation to drug disposition, safety of excipients and limitations with practical usability of dosage forms. The objective of this review is to summarise and discuss current challenges and novel approaches to delivering medications to older adults.",

This study was conducted to gain a deep understanding of the experience of older people with diabetes mellitus (DM) about their family support in Tasikmalaya, Indonesia.
Method
The qualitative design was used with a phenomenological approach. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews of eight older people with DM. Ethical clearance was obtained from The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Nursing, University of Indonesia. All the participants were provided with information about the purpose and the type of the study. Participants’ type of participation in this research was voluntary. The recorded interviews were reported anonymously. Data were analyzed using the seven steps of Colaizzi include reading the transcript, listening to the transcript, choosing keywords, categorizing grouping, creating narratives, validating, and translating findings into a complete narrative.
Results
Three themes were identified about family support toward older people with DM such as the changes in older people with DM, optimum family support and suboptimal family support.
Conclusions
The physical and psychological changes which older people with DM had experienced affect the family support they had received. Therefore, this study will give a valuable contribution to the improvement of health service for older people with DM in Indonesia.",

Net Step Exercise, a novel dual-task walking program, introduced residents to opportunities for physical activities and social participation without any health specialist support. In one depopulated town (Ikeda, Nakagawa-gun, Hokkaido, Japan), volunteer residents have held Net Step Exercise classes throughout the town since 2007. We longitudinally examined the influence of volunteer-led Net Step Exercise class participation on subsequent self-rated health in all individuals aged 70–79 years living in Ikeda. A total of 662 people who completed a baseline mail-in questionnaire survey in 2012 were followed until 2014. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association with self-rated health after two years of class participation once a month or more at baseline, after controlling for confounds such as age, sex, years of education, living alone, baseline self-rated health, regular exercise, and other physical activities. The odds ratio of poor self-rated health in older people who participated in classes was 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.85) compared to older people not participating in classes. Even after confounding factors were adjusted, the odds ratio of class participation was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29–0.85). This study showed that participation in volunteer-led Net Step Exercise might prevent poor self-rated health. Such Net Step Exercise classes are a feasible method for older people’s health promotion in depopulated municipalities.",

When a disaster occurs older people are recognised to be among one of the vulnerable population groups. During the Great East Japan earthquake in 2011, there were numerous unresolved health and social issues for the survivors.
Aim of the study
To understand which challenges older people that survived the 2011 disaster faced, which aspects they identified as concerns and what they felt was difficult and possibly could not recover from in the near future.
Methods
A qualitative case study method was used. Sixteen participants, living in temporary housing, were interviewed in 2015. The interview data was analysed using thematic analysis.
Findings and discussion
Participants (4 men; 12 women) were aged between 65 and 89 years. Seven participants stated that they were healthy although they had minor health issues. Some women had psycho-social health issues brought about by the trauma they experienced, caring for their aging relatives and living in temporary housing. Four themes emerged: feeling grateful to be alive; issues related to health and mental health; the importance of recreational activities and community involvement; feeling of fear, uncertainty and vulnerability.
Conclusions
This is the first study to report directly participants’ feelings and views after their traumatic experience. All participants were happy to be interviewed and to express their views. Although participants expressed their need for health professional services to be available to support them following traumatic events, these services are yet to be recognised as an essential part of the recovery process.",
