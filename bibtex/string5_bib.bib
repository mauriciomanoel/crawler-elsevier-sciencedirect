abstract = "One of the most critical issues in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is the design of systems that can evolve to meet the requirements of individuals as their needs and health conditions change. Although much work has been done on home and building automation systems for AAL, often referred to as assistive domotics, there is in fact still a substantial lack of solutions capable to support system designers in the early stage of development of such assistive systems. To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things is a natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. The aim is to design cross-domain applications that compose and select most relevant services, which best match user requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. However, semantic description and representation of such smart devices, including their hosted services and their provided real world data, is still a challenging issue. Semantic Web technologies are seen as a promising tool for this purpose. Indeed, applying these technologies in the Internet of Things enables smart objects to efficiently share their data, exchange their services and cooperate to better satisfy both functional and non-functional user requirements. In this paper, we propose a new semantic model for smart objects description and users request resolution using ontological techniques combined with description logics. Such a model facilitates intelligent functions, including reasoning over service data and semantic interoperability enabling among devices. A case study for smart environment monitoring has been proposed to illustrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach.",

Nonetheless, the resulting processes at the time of handover to the series production need to be mature, thoroughly tested and optimized to minimize problems and delays in the ramp-up. Recently, assistance systems for the manual assembly have received extensive attention in research and practice. However, they were almost exclusively applied to the series production, while little regard was dedicated to the potential such systems can offer for development and planning. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to leverage worker assistance systems for the assembly process development and evaluation during the prototype assembly in series development. A general approach and design for such a system is described and observations from a company are presented where a corresponding solution was piloted.",

abstract = "Data sharing is pivotal in current medical practice so as to better treat patients by taking the best medical decisions, and to optimize healthcare costs by reducing the need to repeat unnecessary medical tests and by better managing healthcare structures. To improve the delivery of treatment outcomes and test results, the request-triggered retrieval of clinical documents provided by current Health Information Systems is not sufficient. The addition of a notification solution is necessary to inform users as soon as their clinical documents of interest have been produced so that they can retrieve them by means of the traditional Health Information Systems. In addition, this notification solution also has to implement the event-based information exchange patterns, which characterize the current attempts at integrating heterogeneous Health Information Systems in a seamless manner. This paper proposes an architecture for an effective asynchronous notification of clinical documents. Our intention is to bridge the gap between primary and secondary care, and between the clinical personnel and the administrators. The proposed solution is based on a publish/subscribe service, properly extended to allow us to jointly notify collections of correlated documents. Moreover, it has been implemented by means of a web service-based platform in accordance with the Web Service Notification specification so as to obtain a solution easy to integrate and manage. A systematic analysis has been carried out to assess the suitability of the implemented solution to satisfy the requirements for notifying medical documents, and to evaluate the notification latency in different use conditions.",

abstract = "Considering that the world population is aging, health-support issues are in evidence, and many dangerous situations concerning users in their living environment may arise. This paper presents an approach to allow Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems to identify and predict situations that may endanger users in their living environment. Elderly people generally have difficulties to perform daily activities as using some electronic device, cooking, dressing among others. This paper offers an alternative to acquire comprehension of a former person's behavioral providing this knowledge when cognitive impairments will occur. This is a significant improvement to traditional expert systems applied to AAL as the handling of the knowledge base is adapted to the failing users’ behavior. We consider the user profile dynamics where new and different situations not initially planned in the development of the systems may occur. This approach was developed considering the principles of reactive and proactive behavior and the extensibility capacity of the system. Systems developed following the above-described principles can react to the current situations and anticipate proactively a dangerous situation eliminating it or controlling its impact. The approach is evaluated and verified by a case study where unwanted, dangerous situations were created and subsequently detected. The case study is based on a simulated smart house fulfilled with sensors and appliances. An application was build based on the developed approach, and it was capable of choosing the most appropriate actions to solve the unwanted situations. The main contributions of the present work are the identification and prediction of situations in smart houses, an approach developed with the principles of reactive and proactive behavior validated with a case study and supported by a probabilistic ontology.",

In this situation, it is safe to group active prosumers into groups or coalitions. By utilising analytical tools, like game theory, the method for grouping or coalition formation of prosumers can be carefully studied. After analysing prosumers behaviour in energy profile, we propose a novel dynamic, decentralised prosumer coalition formation method based on game theory that can satisfy utility grid demands. A conceptual framework is developed for coalition formation and energy management among prosumers in a dynamic environment. This approach has the potential to increase the size and number of coalitions without a central controller to better manage renewable energy usage and trading with energy buyers. We validate the performance of adopting a game theoretic approach, assessing the strategy using open and shared data sources.",

abstract = "A growing number of elderly people (65+ years old) are affected by particular conditions, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and frailty, which are characterized by a gradual cognitive and physical decline. Early symptoms may spread across years and often they are noticed only at late stages, when the outcomes remain irrevocable and require costly intervention plans. Therefore, the clinical utility of early detecting these conditions is of substantial importance in order to avoid hospitalization and lessen the socio-economic costs of caring, while it may also significantly improve elderly people’s quality of life. This work deals with a critical performance analysis of an Internet of Things aware Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system for elderly monitoring. The analysis is focused on three main system components: (i) the City-wide data capturing layer, (ii) the Cloud-based centralized data management repository, and (iii) the risk analysis and prediction module. Each module can provide different operating modes, therefore the critical analysis aims at defining which are the best solutions according to context’s needs. The proposed system architecture is used by the H2020 City4Age project to support geriatricians for the early detection of MCI and frailty conditions.",
