abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

abstract = "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems intend to provide services that enable people with specific needs to live an independent and safe life. Emergency treatment services are critical, time-constrained, and require compliance to numerous non-functional (or quality) requirements. In conventional approaches, often, non-functional requirements are kept outside the modeling scope and as such, their verification is also overlooked. For this reason, the specification and verification of Non-functional requirements (NFR) in this kind of services is a key issue. This paper presents a verification approach based on timed traces semantics and a methodology based on UML-RT models (MEDISTAM-RT) to check the fulfillment of non-functional requirements, such as timeliness and safety (deadlock freeness), and to assure the correct functioning of the AAL systems. We validate this approach by its application to an Emergency Assistance System for monitoring people suffering from cardiac alteration with syncope.",

Although much work has been done on home and building automation systems for AAL, often referred to as assistive domotics, there is in fact still a substantial lack of solutions capable to support system designers in the early stage of development of such assistive systems. To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

For these systems, Non Functional Requirements (NFR's) play an important role, and one has to identify as early as possible the requirements that are adaptable.

Relax, which is a Requirement Engineering (RE) language for adaptive systems, can introduce ﬂexibility in NFR's to adapt to any changing environmental conditions. We illustrate our proposal through a case study of an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system. We use an existing goal oriented approach, based on Kaos, which extends the SysML 11http://www.sysml.org/specsmeta-model and our proposed Domain Speciﬁc Language (DSL) for Relax; that enables to derive requirements in graphical format from textual requirements in the form of SysML requirements diagrams.

In particular, systematically addressing Non-Functional Requirements such as dynamicity and adaptation, that are important features of ubiquitous systems, eventually leads to higher quality designs. In this paper, a Requirements Engineering Method for the analysis of Ubiquitous Systems, called REUBI, is introduced. It is a goal-based method that represents the influence of context and adverse situations, providing an evaluation procedure to help in the decision making about objectives satisfaction. The proposal is illustrated through the analysis of a Positioning Service of a real system. Additionally, the application of the method has been evaluated by a team of software engineers for the analysis of an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) health care system.",

abstract = "Context
The current studies on IoT in healthcare have reviewed the uses of this technology in a combination of healthcare domains, including nursing, rehabilitation sciences, ambient assisted living (AAL), medicine, etc. However, no review study has scrutinized IoT advances exclusively in medicine irrespective of other healthcare domains.
Objectives
The purpose of the current study was to identify and map the current IoT developments in medicine through providing graphical/tabular classifications on the current experimental and practical IoT information in medicine, the involved medical sub-fields, the locations of IoT use in medicine, and the bibliometric information about IoT research articles.
Methods
In this systematic mapping study, the studies published between 2000 and 2018 in major online scientific databases, including IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were screened. A total of 3679 papers were found from which 89 papers were finally selected based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Results
While the majority of medical IoT studies were experimental and prototyping in nature, they generally reported that home was the most popular place for medical IoT applications. It was also found that neurology, cardiology, and psychiatry/psychology were the medical sub-fields receiving the most IoT attention. Bibliometric analysis showed that IEEE Internet of Things Journal has published the most influential IoT articles. India, China and the United States were found to be the most involved countries in medical IoT research.
Conclusions
Although IoT has not yet been employed in some medical sub-fields, recent substantial surge in the number of medical IoT studies will most likely lead to the engagement of more medical sub-fields in the years to come. IoT literature also shows that the ambiguity of assigning a variety of terms to IoT, namely system, platform, device, tool, etc., and the interchangeable uses of these terms require a taxonomy study to investigate the precise definition of these terms. Other areas of research have also been mentioned at the end of this article.",

Although many initiatives have contributed to the quality improvement of microservices-based systems, there is still a lack of a systematic understanding of the Quality Attributes (QAs) associated with MSA. Objective: This study aims to investigate the evidence-based state-of-the-art of QAs of microservices-based systems. Method: We carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and synthesize the relevant studies that report evidence related to QAs of MSA. Results: Based on the data extracted from the 72 selected primary studies, we portray an overview of the six identified QAs most concerned in MSA, scalability, performance, availability, monitorability, security, and testability. We identify 19 tactics that architecturally address the critical QAs in MSA, including two tactics for scalability, four for performance, four for availability, four for monitorability, three for security, and two for testability. Conclusion: This SLR concludes that for MSA-based systems: 1) Although scalability is the commonly acknowledged benefit of MSA, it is still an indispensable concern among the identified QAs, especially when trading-off with other QAs, e.g., performance. Apart from the six identified QAs in this study, other QAs for MSA like maintainability need more attention for effective improvement and evaluation in the future. 3) Practitioners need to carefully make the decision of migrating to MSA based on the return on investment, since this architectural style additionally cause some pains in practice.",

In this paper, we propose a VoIP-based VoDSL architecture that provides QoS guarantees comparable to those offered by ATM in the DSL access network. Our QoS architecture supports Premium and Regular service categories for voice traffic and the Best-Effort service category for data traffic. The Weighted Fair Queuing algorithm is used to schedule voice and data packets for transmission over the bottleneck link. Fragmentation of large data packets reduces the waiting time for voice packets in the link. We also propose a new admission control mechanism called Admission Control by Implicit Signaling. This mechanism takes advantage of application layer signaling by mapping it to the IP header. We evaluate the performance of our QoS architecture by means of a simulation study. Our results show that our VoIP architecture can provide QoS comparable to that provided by the VoATM architecture.",

abstract = "Measurement is essential to any programme of quality improvement. The manufacturer of a system must be able to measure its dependability. This comprises attributes such as reliability, safety and security, which are external attributes of the system and are measured indirectly by analysis of direct measurements extracted from raw data. An essential part of the collection of raw data is the measurement of failures during system trial and operation. Some will be due to the physical failure of hardware components, others to design faults in hardware, software, or the user interface. Where a design fault is diagnosed, a corrective change is usually made to remove it, and improve dependability. Measurement of dependability requires that the basic entities failure, fault, and change, are measured in a rigorous, consistent, yet practical way. The paper applies principles of scientific measurement to these entities, and defines a set of attributes measured on orthogonal scales, so that measurements of different attributes may be made independently. The proposed scheme is completely general, but can be adapted to any real measurement programme.",

The results show that the coupling is weak for modes with energies below the zone boundary surface phonons and is well described by an elastic treatment of the substrate. Whereas modes with higher energies mix strongly with some of the zone boundary surface phonons accompanied with large broadenings and shifts from the mode energy in the rigid lattice situation. The corresponding strong satellite structures caused by this mixing could possibly be observed by vibrational spectroscopy like inelastic He scattering. Furthermore, the broadening and the shift in the elastic limit of the central nearest neighboring force constant model are compared with the results from an isotropic continuum model.",

Ei cyst formation is blocked by the chitinase-inhibitor allosamidin. Here molecular cloning techniques were used to identify homologous genes of Eh, Ed, and Ei that encode chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14). The Eh gene (Eh cht1) predicts a 507-amino acid (aa) enzyme, which has 93 and 74% positional identities with Ed and Ei chitinases, respectively. The Entamoeba chitinases have signal sequences, followed by acidic and hydrophilic sequences composed of multiple tandemly arranged 7-aa repeats (Eh and Ed) or repeats varying in length (Ei). The aa compositions of the chitinase repeats are similar to those of the repeats of the Eh and Ed Ser-rich proteins. The COOH-terminus of each chitinase has a catalytic domain, which resembles those of Brugia malayi (33% positional identity) and Manduca sexta (29%). Recombinant Entamoeba chitinases are precipitated by chitin and show chitinase activity with chitooligosacharide substrates.

abstract = "Summary
Data from both rodents and humans show that testosterone reduces fear. This effect is hypothesized to result from testosterone's down regulating effects on the amygdala, a key region in the detection of threat and instigator of fight-or-flight behavior. However, neuroimaging studies employing testosterone administration in humans have consistently shown increased amygdala responsivity. Yet, no study to date has investigated specifically how testosterone affects the amygdala response to fearful emotional expressions. Such stimuli signal the presence of environmental threat and elicit robust amygdala responses that have consistently been associated with anxious traits. In the present study, we therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with a single administration of 0.5mg testosterone in 12 healthy women to assess testosterone's effects on amygdala responses to dynamic fearful (and happy control) faces. Our results show that both stimuli activate the amygdala. Notably, testosterone increased the amygdala response to both stimuli, and to an equal degree. Thus, testosterone appears not to reduce fear by attenuating the amygdala response toward signals of threat. Data further show that testosterone selectively increases activation of the superficial amygdala (SFA) and, to a lesser extent, the basolateral amygdala (BLA). No effect was found in the central nucleus, which is involved in the generation of autonomic fear responses. Both the SFA and BLA are considered input regions, and enhanced activation by testosterone might reflect the role of this hormone in adaptive responding to socially relevant stimuli. Furthermore, literature on the distinct roles of the SFA and BLA in fear processing show that increased activation of these subregions of the amygdala is consistent with a fear reducing effect of testosterone.",

abstract = "To the extent that rock deformation can be approximated by a two-dimensional Newtonian model, a powerful stream-function simulation method is applicable. The significance of stream functions is that velocity, strain, stress and energy derived from the same stream function satisfy automatically three basic conditions of dynamics: 1.(1) the condition of continuity.2.(2) the Navier-Stokes equations.3.(3) conservation of energy. Hence we state with Jaeger: “If a stream function can be found which satisfies the boundary conditions of a dynamic model the complete solution follows.” All pertinent bits of dynamic information are implied in the stream function from which they can be directly derived, guaranteed—so to speak—not to violate the basic conditions of dynamics. Stream functions useful in structural geology are solutions of: ∇4ϵ=∂4ψ∂x4+2∂4ψ∂x2∂y2+∂4ψ∂y4=0 A double-polynomial solution of max. degree 14 is developed, in which the coefficients are related controlled by the ▽4ψ = 0 constraint, and their absolute values are determined by the boundary conditions of specific models and by the condition of maximum rate of energy dissipation or maximum rate of decline of potential energy. The polynomial stream function is applied to a collapsing viscous “nappe” consisting of a thin basal layer with low viscosity on which a thicker layer with high viscosity slides due to gravitational spreading. The velocity of forward movement depends upon absolute and relative values of the following parameters: viscosity, thickness, the aspect ratio and density. The velocity of a variety of nappes with different thicknesses, aspect ratios, viscosities and densities is determined.",

Samples were analyzed for total phenolic compounds (TP), flavonoids, antioxidant capacity (AC), tannins and total anthocyanins. Type and quantity were evaluated by HPLC-ESI-MS. Delphinidin glucoside (0.9–129.0mg/100g dry coat), petunidin glucoside (0.7–115.0mg/100g dry coat) and malvidin glucoside (0.14–52.0mg/100g dry coat). Anthocyanidins were positively correlated when quantified by HPLC and colorimetric analysis (R=0.99). Cultivar Negro-Otomi presented the highest concentration of anthocyanins (250mg/100g dry coat). Seventeen non-colored phenolic compounds were identified among cultivars; catechin, myricetin 3-O-arabinoside, epicatechin, vanillic acid, syringic acid and o-coumaric acid, presented the highest concentrations among identified phenolic compounds.

In addition, inhibitory activity is generated after inhalation challenge. In the present study we have investigated the relationship of heat-labile NCA to the development of the late asthmatic reaction (LAR) in 13 subjects with asthma after allergen challenge and the effects of asthma medication on the formation of this activity. Heat-labile NCA peaked 120 to 240 minutes after challenge and demonstrated at this time significant (p < 0.001) quantitative relationships to the ensuing LAR. The inhalant corticosteroid, budesonide, significantly inhibited (p < 0.001) the generation of heat-labile NCA and the development of LAR both after a single dose and after 4 weeks of pretreatment. Single-dose disodium cromoglycate pretreatment, initially, slightly enhanced (p < 0.05) heat-labile NCA but, after 120 minutes, slightly inhibited (p < 0.05) the activity. Disodium cromoglycate also slightly abrogated the development of LAR. Single-dose pretreatment with the β2-agonist, terbutaline, inhibited generation of heat-labile NCA (p < 0.001) but was without effect on LAR. It is concluded that the generation of heat-labile NCA is related to the development of the LAR and may be of importance for the attraction of inflammatory cells to the lung in the development of the inflammatory reaction probably responsible for LAR. However, the pharmacologic control of heat-labile NCA indicates that the process is multifactorial and not solely dependent on the generation of NCAs detected in serum.",

abstract = "The insect ventral nerve cord consists of metamerically repeated ganglia subserving the thoracic and abdominal segments. The abdominal ganglia control basic functions such as respiration, circulation, heartbeat, diuresis, hindgut motility, functions of the genitalia and ovipositor and abdominal posture. Some of this control is by efferent innervation of target tissues but hormonal control also is exerted by abdominal neurosecretory cells via release from neurohemal organs or other release sites. The present review summarizes what is known about the distribution of neurotransmitters, monoamines and neuropeptides in the abdominal ganglia of different insect species. Special emphasis is on the unfused abdominal ganglion, since this is the least complex of all central ganglia and therefore may reveal the minimum number of neuroactive compounds utilized in neurotransmission, neuromodulation and neurohormonal control. Both GABA and glutamate are present in both interneurons and motoneurons, whereas biogenic amines such as serotonin, dopamine and histamine are found primarily in interneurons (although some cases of sensory cells and efferent neurons are known). Octopamine can be seen both in interneurons, efferent neurons and neurosecretory cells. A large number (about 20 different main types) of neuropeptides has been indicated in abdominal ganglia. Each peptide has a very specific distribution pattern. Depending on the peptide type, the localization is known to be in interneurons, neurosecretory cells or motoneurons, or combinations of these. The structure and known functions of the different neuropeptides in different insect species are summarized in some detail. Both GABA and glutamate appear to have roles as fast neurotransmitters, whereas amines and neuropeptides seem to have modulatory roles both within the CNS and at peripheral targets. After a comprehensive overview of different substances in studied insect species, the unfused abdominal ganglia from the moth Manduca sexta, locusts and cockroaches are dealt with in some detail and a comparison is made with insects possessing fused abdominal ganglia such as blowflies and Drosophila. Some emphasis is made of the presence of neuroactive compounds in neurosecretory cells and other identifiable neurons for which physiological analysis is feasible.",
