abstract = "One of the most critical issues in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is the design of systems that can evolve to meet the requirements of individuals as their needs and health conditions change. Although much work has been done on home and building automation systems for AAL, often referred to as assistive domotics, there is in fact still a substantial lack of solutions capable to support system designers in the early stage of development of such assistive systems. To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things is a natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. The aim is to design cross-domain applications that compose and select most relevant services, which best match user requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. However, semantic description and representation of such smart devices, including their hosted services and their provided real world data, is still a challenging issue. Semantic Web technologies are seen as a promising tool for this purpose. Indeed, applying these technologies in the Internet of Things enables smart objects to efficiently share their data, exchange their services and cooperate to better satisfy both functional and non-functional user requirements. In this paper, we propose a new semantic model for smart objects description and users request resolution using ontological techniques combined with description logics. Such a model facilitates intelligent functions, including reasoning over service data and semantic interoperability enabling among devices. A case study for smart environment monitoring has been proposed to illustrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach.",

The platform also abstracts the complexities of scheduling, planning and execution of these tasks, and can automatically adjust parameters to the personal profile and current context.

Better supporting elderly people to continue live in their home using smart home technology is a key target application. However, most of the existing smart home solutions for the elderly are not designed with people‚Äôs emotional goals in mind, leading to lack of adoption, lack of engagement, and failure of the technology. In this paper, we introduce an emotion-oriented requirements engineering approach to help identifying, modeling and evaluating emotional goals. We also explain how we used this technique to help us develop SofiHub - a new smart home platform for elderly people. SofiHub comprises a range of devices and software for sensing, interaction, passive monitoring, and emergency assistance. We have conducted multiple trials including initial field trials for elderly people in real houses. We have used our emotion-oriented requirements techniques to evaluate the participants‚Äô emotional reactions before, during, and after trials to understand the impact of such technology on elderly people‚Äôs emotions to the SofiHub solution. Our analysis shows that SofiHub successfully alleviates their loneliness, makes them feel safer and cared about. We also found that the trial participants developed a strong relation with the system and hence, felt frustrated when SofiHub did not respond in ways expected or desired. We reflect on the lessons learned from the trials related to our emotion-oriented design and evaluation experimental approach, including refining our set of evaluation tools.",

Moreover, the method facilitates the agent creation automation process, reducing the time required for its development and simplifying the design complexity.

abstract = "Background
Population aging is inducing governments to redesign their healthcare models. One policy measure aimed at reducing healthcare expenditures and improving services is to encourage people to age-in-place. Scientific research has been trying to find ICT-enabled solutions to the growing problem of elderly home care. However, such research is often technology-oriented and neglects the end-user perspective. It does not consider the real needs of older people and all stakeholders involved in their healthcare.
Method
A user-centered design approach was adopted with the involvement of older people, experts dealing with the aging population, and the whole stakeholders‚Äô chain. Through surveys, focus groups, and brainstorming sessions, it was possible to determine the main features of the product service platform.
Results
Starting from a large-scale survey of elderly people living in Italy, this paper presents the requirements and the architecture of a product service platform aimed at improving the independence and elderly quality of life. This work proposes an elderly-centered platform that works as an aggregation point of an articulated social health system, provides multiple tailored services, and optimizes the use of local resources.
Conclusions
The involvement of the end-user and all the stakeholders allowed for the consideration of different perspectives and the creation of a value network that aggregates existing services, resources, and information with new opportunities to achieve common benefits. This work provides guidelines on how to develop this type of platform by exploiting the potential of each stakeholder without creating new barriers. Technology, caregivers, and society are combined synergistically to provide tailored services able to satisfy specific users‚Äô needs.",

Objective.We study whether a synergy between humans‚Äô analytic capabilities and natural language processing is an effective approach for quickly identifying near-synonyms, a possible source of terminological ambiguity. Method.We propose a tool-supported approach that blends information visualization with two natural language processing techniques: conceptual model extraction and semantic similarity. We evaluate the precision and recall of our approach compared to a pen-and-paper manual inspection session through a controlled quasi-experiment that involves 57 participants organized into 28 groups, each group working on one real-world requirements data set. Results.The experimental results indicate that manual inspection delivers higher recall (statistically significant with p‚ÄØ‚â§‚ÄØ0.01) and non-significantly higher precision. Based on qualitative observations, we analyze the quantitative results and suggest interpretations that explain the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Conclusions.Our experiment confirms conventional wisdom in requirements engineering: identifying terminological ambiguities is time consuming, even when with tool support; and it is hard to determine whether a near-synonym may challenge the correct development of a software system. The results suggest that the most effective approach may be a combination of manual inspection with an improved version of our tool.",

To improve the delivery of treatment outcomes and test results, the request-triggered retrieval of clinical documents provided by current Health Information Systems is not sufficient. The addition of a notification solution is necessary to inform users as soon as their clinical documents of interest have been produced so that they can retrieve them by means of the traditional Health Information Systems. In addition, this notification solution also has to implement the event-based information exchange patterns, which characterize the current attempts at integrating heterogeneous Health Information Systems in a seamless manner. This paper proposes an architecture for an effective asynchronous notification of clinical documents. Our intention is to bridge the gap between primary and secondary care, and between the clinical personnel and the administrators. The proposed solution is based on a publish/subscribe service, properly extended to allow us to jointly notify collections of correlated documents. Moreover, it has been implemented by means of a web service-based platform in accordance with the Web Service Notification specification so as to obtain a solution easy to integrate and manage. A systematic analysis has been carried out to assess the suitability of the implemented solution to satisfy the requirements for notifying medical documents, and to evaluate the notification latency in different use conditions.",

After analysing prosumers behaviour in energy profile, we propose a novel dynamic, decentralised prosumer coalition formation method based on game theory that can satisfy utility grid demands. A conceptual framework is developed for coalition formation and energy management among prosumers in a dynamic environment. This approach has the potential to increase the size and number of coalitions without a central controller to better manage renewable energy usage and trading with energy buyers.

abstract = "Considering that the world population is aging, health-support issues are in evidence, and many dangerous situations concerning users in their living environment may arise. This paper presents an approach to allow Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems to identify and predict situations that may endanger users in their living environment. Elderly people generally have difficulties to perform daily activities as using some electronic device, cooking, dressing among others. This paper offers an alternative to acquire comprehension of a former person's behavioral providing this knowledge when cognitive impairments will occur. This is a significant improvement to traditional expert systems applied to AAL as the handling of the knowledge base is adapted to the failing users‚Äô behavior. We consider the user profile dynamics where new and different situations not initially planned in the development of the systems may occur. This approach was developed considering the principles of reactive and proactive behavior and the extensibility capacity of the system. Systems developed following the above-described principles can react to the current situations and anticipate proactively a dangerous situation eliminating it or controlling its impact. The approach is evaluated and verified by a case study where unwanted, dangerous situations were created and subsequently detected. The case study is based on a simulated smart house fulfilled with sensors and appliances. An application was build based on the developed approach, and it was capable of choosing the most appropriate actions to solve the unwanted situations. The main contributions of the present work are the identification and prediction of situations in smart houses, an approach developed with the principles of reactive and proactive behavior validated with a case study and supported by a probabilistic ontology.",

Smart homes, where ambient and biomedical sensors can coexist, have become a suitable approach to address the main goals of home care scenarios: preventive care, recognizing deteriorating health and allowing a personalized care. To achieve these goals, applications have to exhibit adaptability and availability among other characteristics. Adaptability allows tracking the patient's state as well as reacting to abnormal situations. Availability ensures the execution of the application under failure of processing devices. In order to meet these requirements, this paper proposes a general-purpose middleware architecture based on multi-agent technology that provides mechanisms to: develop customizable applications based on the separation of concerns principle; manage the execution of applications; support adaptability by means of event-based relationships among applications; ensure availability through the use of replicated agents. The performance of the proposed middleware is assessed in terms of reaction time to adapt to irregular situations for different availability levels (number of replicated agents) and number of application services.",

The evolution of software services can be seen as the evolution of system-user interactions. The capability to accurately and efficiently observe users‚Äô volatile requirements is critical to making timely system improvements to adapt to rapidly changing environments. In this paper, we propose a methodology that employs Conditional Random Fields (CRF) as a means to provide quantitative exploration of system-user interactions that often lead to the discovery of users‚Äô potential needs and requirements. By analyzing users' run-time behavioral patterns, domain experts can make prompt predictions on how users‚Äô intentions shift, and timely propose system improvements or remedies to help address emerging needs. Our ultimate research goal is to speed up software service evolution to a great extent with automated tools, knowing that the challenge can be undoubtedly steep.

abstract = "A growing number of elderly people (65+ years old) are affected by particular conditions, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and frailty, which are characterized by a gradual cognitive and physical decline. Early symptoms may spread across years and often they are noticed only at late stages, when the outcomes remain irrevocable and require costly intervention plans. Therefore, the clinical utility of early detecting these conditions is of substantial importance in order to avoid hospitalization and lessen the socio-economic costs of caring, while it may also significantly improve elderly people‚Äôs quality of life. This work deals with a critical performance analysis of an Internet of Things aware Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system for elderly monitoring. The analysis is focused on three main system components: (i) the City-wide data capturing layer, (ii) the Cloud-based centralized data management repository, and (iii) the risk analysis and prediction module. Each module can provide different operating modes, therefore the critical analysis aims at defining which are the best solutions according to context‚Äôs needs. The proposed system architecture is used by the H2020 City4Age project to support geriatricians for the early detection of MCI and frailty conditions.",

The literature shows that researchers modify existing engineering methods in order to better fit the needs of context-aware computing. These efforts are typically disconnected from each other and generally focus on solving specific development issues. We encourage the creation of a more holistic and unified engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these systems. For this purpose, we study the state-of-the-art in the development of context-aware systems, focusing on: (A) Methodologies for developing context-aware systems, analyzing the reasons behind their lack of adoption and features that the community wish they can use; (B) Context-aware system engineering challenges and techniques applied during the most common development stages; (C) Context-aware systems conceptualization.",
