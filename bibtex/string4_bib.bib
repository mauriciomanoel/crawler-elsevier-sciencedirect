abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

abstract = "In order to minimize time-to-market, the development and planning of automotive assembly processes needs to be conducted in early product development stages under high uncertainty, with frequent changes and increasing time and cost pressure. Nonetheless, the resulting processes at the time of handover to the series production need to be mature, thoroughly tested and optimized to minimize problems and delays in the ramp-up. Recently, assistance systems for the manual assembly have received extensive attention in research and practice. However, they were almost exclusively applied to the series production, while little regard was dedicated to the potential such systems can offer for development and planning. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to leverage worker assistance systems for the assembly process development and evaluation during the prototype assembly in series development. A general approach and design for such a system is described and observations from a company are presented where a corresponding solution was piloted.",

abstract = "Data sharing is pivotal in current medical practice so as to better treat patients by taking the best medical decisions, and to optimize healthcare costs by reducing the need to repeat unnecessary medical tests and by better managing healthcare structures. To improve the delivery of treatment outcomes and test results, the request-triggered retrieval of clinical documents provided by current Health Information Systems is not sufficient. The addition of a notification solution is necessary to inform users as soon as their clinical documents of interest have been produced so that they can retrieve them by means of the traditional Health Information Systems. In addition, this notification solution also has to implement the event-based information exchange patterns, which characterize the current attempts at integrating heterogeneous Health Information Systems in a seamless manner. This paper proposes an architecture for an effective asynchronous notification of clinical documents. Our intention is to bridge the gap between primary and secondary care, and between the clinical personnel and the administrators. The proposed solution is based on a publish/subscribe service, properly extended to allow us to jointly notify collections of correlated documents. Moreover, it has been implemented by means of a web service-based platform in accordance with the Web Service Notification specification so as to obtain a solution easy to integrate and manage. A systematic analysis has been carried out to assess the suitability of the implemented solution to satisfy the requirements for notifying medical documents, and to evaluate the notification latency in different use conditions.",

abstract = "Managing prosumers participation in energy trading becomes complicated, as the number of prosumers in smart grid is expected to rise. In this situation, it is safe to group active prosumers into groups or coalitions. By utilising analytical tools, like game theory, the method for grouping or coalition formation of prosumers can be carefully studied. After analysing prosumers behaviour in energy profile, we propose a novel dynamic, decentralised prosumer coalition formation method based on game theory that can satisfy utility grid demands. A conceptual framework is developed for coalition formation and energy management among prosumers in a dynamic environment. This approach has the potential to increase the size and number of coalitions without a central controller to better manage renewable energy usage and trading with energy buyers. We validate the performance of adopting a game theoretic approach, assessing the strategy using open and shared data sources.",

abstract = "A growing number of elderly people (65+ years old) are affected by particular conditions, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and frailty, which are characterized by a gradual cognitive and physical decline. Early symptoms may spread across years and often they are noticed only at late stages, when the outcomes remain irrevocable and require costly intervention plans. Therefore, the clinical utility of early detecting these conditions is of substantial importance in order to avoid hospitalization and lessen the socio-economic costs of caring, while it may also significantly improve elderly people’s quality of life. This work deals with a critical performance analysis of an Internet of Things aware Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system for elderly monitoring. The analysis is focused on three main system components: (i) the City-wide data capturing layer, (ii) the Cloud-based centralized data management repository, and (iii) the risk analysis and prediction module. Each module can provide different operating modes, therefore the critical analysis aims at defining which are the best solutions according to context’s needs. The proposed system architecture is used by the H2020 City4Age project to support geriatricians for the early detection of MCI and frailty conditions.",
