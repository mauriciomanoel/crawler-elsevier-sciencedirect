abstract = "The immense network of interconnected objects, called the Internet of Things (IoT), will eventually become a reality thanks to the MP2P (Mobile Peer-to-Peer) nature of the upcoming 5G and it will have the potential of growing into a valuable asset and revolutionize a plethora of fields. Due to its omnipresent character, the IoT can be successfully deployed in the area of healthcare, allowing this way the efficient management of equipment in medical facilities, as well as the immediate and remote monitoring and treatment of patients. In addition to IoT, cloud computing can also be integrated in such systems, opening this way new doors for the field of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) by taking advantage of the benefits the cloud brings to the table when properly utilized. This chapter briefly presents IoT and cloud computing, as well as how their combination can affect the area of AAL. It also provides information on how cloud services can be used for remotely monitoring the physiological condition of a patient, along with how IoT can be used in gathering the desired data. Additionally, Electronic Health Records (EHR) are presented, followed by how wearable technology, used in AAL, can benefit from an IoT cloud system. Finally, challenges and issues that appear from the utilization of cloud-based IoT for AAL are presented, such as security and privacy requirements, the difficulties in handling the massive amount of data generated, as well as device interoperability issues.",

abstract = "The digital world is expanding rapidly and advances in networking technologies such as 4G long-term evolution (LTE), wireless broadband (WiBro), low-power wide area networks (LPWAN), 5G, LiFi, and so on, all of which are paving the way for the emergence of sophisticated services. The number of online applications is increasing along with more computation, communication, and intelligent capabilities. Although current devices in use today are also getting more powerful in terms of features and capabilities, but they are still incapable of executing smart, autonomous, and intelligent tasks such as those often required for smart healthcare, ambient assisted living (AAL), virtual reality, augmented reality, intelligent vehicular communication, as well as in many services related to smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), Tactile Internet, Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and so on. For many of these applications, we need another entity to execute tasks on behalf of the user’s device and return the results - a technique often called offloading, where tasks are outsourced and the involved entities work in tandem to achieve the ultimate goal of the application. Task offloading is attractive for emerging IoT and cloud computing applications. It can occur between IoT nodes, sensors, edge devices, or fog nodes. Offloading can be performed based on different factors that include computational requirements of an application, load balancing, energy management, latency management, and so on. We present a taxonomy of recent offloading schemes that have been proposed for domains such as fog, cloud computing, and IoT. We also discuss the middleware technologies that enable offloading in a cloud-IoT cases and the factors that are important for offloading in a particular scenario. We also present research opportunities concerning offloading in fog and edge computing.",

abstract = "Enhanced Living Environments (ELE) comprise information and communication technologies (ICT) supporting true Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). It promotes the provision of infrastructures and services for the independent or more autonomous living, via seamless integration of ICT within homes and residences. For this, ELE encompasses the latest developments associated with the Internet of Things, towards services designed for a better help and support for people, or as a general term, to better live their life and interact with their environment. Both, in AAL and ELE, a multitude of heterogeneous applications, involving different stakeholders, have to communicate via a common network environment. Hence, infrastructures have to become pervasive, with an increasing number of distributed devices that will need to communicate between themselves, as well as with centralized services. Moreover, in the context of mobility, temporary co-location of devices will be exploited to build dynamic networks, without a pre-requisite infrastructure, or to complement existing communication infrastructures with ad-hoc ones. The current networking infrastructures are mostly based on the Internet, and were not designed to support the varying requirements for the dynamic interaction processes between human beeings, sensors and systems. The contribution of this book chapter is to understand the technological barriers hindering the widespread realworld usage of AAL/ELE systems and to identify technologies which may help to overcome them. We briefly review the application domains of AAL and ELE, and summarize domains, applications and stakeholders. Necessary requirements are highlighted and state-of-the-art technologies are evaluated against them.",

abstract = "Autonomous virtual agents that operate in complex IoT environments and apply machine learning algorithms face two fundamental challenges: (i) they usually lack sufficient start-up knowledge and (ii) hence are incapable to adequately adjust their internal knowledge base and decision-making policies during runtime to meet specific user requirements and preferences. This is problematic in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and Health-Care (HC) scenarios, since an agent has to expediently operate from the beginning of its lifecycle and adequately address the target users’ needs; without prior user and environmental knowledge, this is not possible. The presented approach addresses these problems by providing a semantic use-case simulation framework that can be tailored to specific AAL and HC use cases. It builds upon a semantic knowledge representation framework to simulate device events and user activities based on semantic task and ambient descriptions. Through such a simulated environment, agents are provided with the ability to learn the best matching actions and to adjust their policies based on generated datasets. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the simulation framework through the evaluation of the chronic kidney disease pathway from the vCare EC project. Thereby, we proof that an agent that uses reinforcement learning (RL) is able to improve its performance during and after the training and thus makes optimal (activity) recommendations to a prospective patient.",

A typical AAL system consists of ubiquitous computing, sensing and communication blocks where wireless ad hoc, body area and sensor networks play a vital role to facilitate the transmission of sensed data from physiological and ambient sensors to the health-care professionals or monitoring facilities. While the end-to-end communication architecture in a typical AAL system remains heterogeneous, the key functional blocks of wireless body area and sensor network impose significant challenges concerning reliability, efficient use of spectrum and energy efficiency. This chapter focuses on an important challenge concerning energy efficient communication in a multi-tier AAL system. Following a thorough analysis of energy efficiency requirements for communication architectures and protocols in AAL, we provide recent research outputs highlighting the design and development of a multi-tier communication protocol.

To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

Nevertheless, there are a lack of methodologies to properly support the development process of these systems. An important part of the Software Engineering lifecycle is the Requirements Engineering stage, as it grounds the bases for system design for their success. In particular, systematically addressing Non-Functional Requirements such as dynamicity and adaptation, that are important features of ubiquitous systems, eventually leads to higher quality designs. In this paper, a Requirements Engineering Method for the analysis of Ubiquitous Systems, called REUBI, is introduced. It is a goal-based method that represents the influence of context and adverse situations, providing an evaluation procedure to help in the decision making about objectives satisfaction. The proposal is illustrated through the analysis of a Positioning Service of a real system. Additionally, the application of the method has been evaluated by a team of software engineers for the analysis of an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) health care system.",

This is transformed into an agent-based model, from which a skeleton of programming code is generated. A case study illustrates this approach. Moreover, 24 engineers expert in model-driven engineering, multi-agent systems and/or health experienced the current approach alongside the three most similar works, by implementing actual systems. Some of these systems were tested by Parkinson patients. The results showed that (1) the current approach reduced the development time, (2) the developed system satisfied a higher percentage of the requirements established for certain Parkinson patients, (3) the usability increased, (4) the performance of the systems improved taking response time into account, and (5) the developers considered that the underlying metamodel is more appropriate for the current goal.",
