abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

abstract = "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems intend to provide services that enable people with specific needs to live an independent and safe life. Emergency treatment services are critical, time-constrained, and require compliance to numerous non-functional (or quality) requirements. In conventional approaches, often, non-functional requirements are kept outside the modeling scope and as such, their verification is also overlooked. For this reason, the specification and verification of Non-functional requirements (NFR) in this kind of services is a key issue. This paper presents a verification approach based on timed traces semantics and a methodology based on UML-RT models (MEDISTAM-RT) to check the fulfillment of non-functional requirements, such as timeliness and safety (deadlock freeness), and to assure the correct functioning of the AAL systems. We validate this approach by its application to an Emergency Assistance System for monitoring people suffering from cardiac alteration with syncope.",

This paper presents an approach to allow Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems to identify and predict situations that may endanger users in their living environment. Elderly people generally have difficulties to perform daily activities as using some electronic device, cooking, dressing among others. This paper offers an alternative to acquire comprehension of a former person's behavioral providing this knowledge when cognitive impairments will occur. This is a significant improvement to traditional expert systems applied to AAL as the handling of the knowledge base is adapted to the failing users’ behavior. We consider the user profile dynamics where new and different situations not initially planned in the development of the systems may occur. This approach was developed considering the principles of reactive and proactive behavior and the extensibility capacity of the system. Systems developed following the above-described principles can react to the current situations and anticipate proactively a dangerous situation eliminating it or controlling its impact. The approach is evaluated and verified by a case study where unwanted, dangerous situations were created and subsequently detected. The case study is based on a simulated smart house fulfilled with sensors and appliances. An application was build based on the developed approach, and it was capable of choosing the most appropriate actions to solve the unwanted situations. The main contributions of the present work are the identification and prediction of situations in smart houses, an approach developed with the principles of reactive and proactive behavior validated with a case study and supported by a probabilistic ontology.",

To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

Early symptoms may spread across years and often they are noticed only at late stages, when the outcomes remain irrevocable and require costly intervention plans. Therefore, the clinical utility of early detecting these conditions is of substantial importance in order to avoid hospitalization and lessen the socio-economic costs of caring, while it may also significantly improve elderly people’s quality of life. This work deals with a critical performance analysis of an Internet of Things aware Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system for elderly monitoring. The analysis is focused on three main system components: (i) the City-wide data capturing layer, (ii) the Cloud-based centralized data management repository, and (iii) the risk analysis and prediction module. Each module can provide different operating modes, therefore the critical analysis aims at defining which are the best solutions according to context’s needs. The proposed system architecture is used by the H2020 City4Age project to support geriatricians for the early detection of MCI and frailty conditions.",

It is a goal-based method that represents the influence of context and adverse situations, providing an evaluation procedure to help in the decision making about objectives satisfaction. The proposal is illustrated through the analysis of a Positioning Service of a real system.

However, semantic description and representation of such smart devices, including their hosted services and their provided real world data, is still a challenging issue. Semantic Web technologies are seen as a promising tool for this purpose. Indeed, applying these technologies in the Internet of Things enables smart objects to efficiently share their data, exchange their services and cooperate to better satisfy both functional and non-functional user requirements.

Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising paradigm due to the growing number of devices that may be connected, defined as “things”. Managing these “things” is still considered a challenge. One way to overcome this challenge may be by adopting the software product line (SPL) paradigm and the variability management (VM) activity. SPL engineering consists of mechanisms that provide identification, representation, and traceability, which may be helpful to “things” management supported by VM organizational and technical activities.
Objective
This research aims to investigate how SPL engineering has been applied along with the IoT paradigm, as well as how VM is being carried out.
Method
A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted considering papers available until March 2019. This systematic review identified 1039 papers. After eliminating the duplicated titles and the ones not related to the review, 112 papers remained. The number of papers was narrowed to 56 after applying the exclusion criteria.
Results
The results provide evidence on the diversity of proposed SPLs used to specify approaches for managing IoT systems. However, most SPLs and research developed for IoT lack a systematic and detailed specification to ensure their quality, as well as tailoring guidelines for further use.",

Objective: This paper aims to investigate existing literature dealing with the development process of CDSSs for monitoring chronic diseases, analysing their functionalities and characteristics, and the software engineering representation in their design. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted to analyse the literature on CDSSs for monitoring chronic diseases and the application of software engineering techniques in their design. Results: Fourteen included studies revealed that the most addressed disease was diabetes (42.8%) and the most commonly proposed approach was diagnostic (85.7%). Regarding data sources, the studies show a predominance on the use of databases (85.7%), with other data sources such as sensors (42.8%) and self-report (28.6%) also being considered. Analysing the representation for engineering techniques, we found Behaviour diagrams (42.8%) to be the most frequent, closely followed by Structural diagrams (35.7%) and others (78.6%) being largely mentioned. Some studies also approached the requirement specification (21.4%). The most common target evaluation was the performance of the system (64.2%) and the most common metric was accuracy (57.1%). Conclusion: We conclude that software engineering, in its completeness, has scarce representation in studies focused on the development of CDSSs for chronic diseases.",

abstract = "Context
Software companies that develop their products on a basis of service-oriented architecture can expect various improvements as a result of choreography. Current choreography practices, however, are not yet used extensively in the embedded systems domain even though service-oriented architecture is increasingly used in this domain.
Objective
The objective of this study is to identify current features of the use of choreography in the embedded systems domain for practitioners and researchers by systematically analysing current developments in the scientific literature, strategies for choreography adaption, choreography specification and execution types, and implicit assumptions about choreography.
Method
To fulfil this objective, a systematic literature review of scientific publications that focus on the use of choreography in the embedded systems domain was carried out. After a systematic screening of 6823 publications, 48 were selected as primary studies and analysed using thematic synthesis.
Results
The main results of the study showed that there are differences in how choreography is used in embedded and non-embedded systems domain. In the embedded systems domain, it is used to capture the service interactions of a single organisation, while, for example, in the enterprise systems domain it captures the service interactions among multiple organisations. Additionally, the results indicate that the use of choreography can lead to improvements in system performance and that the languages that are used for choreography modelling in the embedded systems domain are insufficiently expressive to capture the complexities that are typical in this domain.
Conclusion
The selection of the key information resources and the identified gaps in the existing literature offer researchers a foundation for further investigations and contribute to the advancement of the use of choreography in the embedded systems domain. The study results facilitate the work of practitioners by allowing them to make informed decisions about the applicability of choreography in their organisations.",

The platform also abstracts the complexities of scheduling, planning and execution of these tasks, and can automatically adjust parameters to the personal profile and current context.

We outline the basic components required and essential for the same. We believe that a context-aware ecosystem becomes effective when these components are designed and implemented effectively. We call it the MOM of context-aware systems: generic and effective context Modeling, an efficient context Organization, and a robust context Middleware. Context modeling affords a syntax to the raw pieces of relevant information, the organization mechanism furnishes semantic import to the information and relationships, and the middleware compiles and integrates the information, enabling sharing of context. We discuss various context-aware ecosystems and middleware from the literature and highlight how the three building components function in each case.

abstract = "Background
Population aging is inducing governments to redesign their healthcare models. One policy measure aimed at reducing healthcare expenditures and improving services is to encourage people to age-in-place. Scientific research has been trying to find ICT-enabled solutions to the growing problem of elderly home care. However, such research is often technology-oriented and neglects the end-user perspective. It does not consider the real needs of older people and all stakeholders involved in their healthcare.
Method
A user-centered design approach was adopted with the involvement of older people, experts dealing with the aging population, and the whole stakeholders’ chain. Through surveys, focus groups, and brainstorming sessions, it was possible to determine the main features of the product service platform.
Results
Starting from a large-scale survey of elderly people living in Italy, this paper presents the requirements and the architecture of a product service platform aimed at improving the independence and elderly quality of life. This work proposes an elderly-centered platform that works as an aggregation point of an articulated social health system, provides multiple tailored services, and optimizes the use of local resources.
Conclusions
The involvement of the end-user and all the stakeholders allowed for the consideration of different perspectives and the creation of a value network that aggregates existing services, resources, and information with new opportunities to achieve common benefits. This work provides guidelines on how to develop this type of platform by exploiting the potential of each stakeholder without creating new barriers. Technology, caregivers, and society are combined synergistically to provide tailored services able to satisfy specific users’ needs.",

Smart homes, where ambient and biomedical sensors can coexist, have become a suitable approach to address the main goals of home care scenarios: preventive care, recognizing deteriorating health and allowing a personalized care. To achieve these goals, applications have to exhibit adaptability and availability among other characteristics. Adaptability allows tracking the patient's state as well as reacting to abnormal situations. Availability ensures the execution of the application under failure of processing devices. In order to meet these requirements, this paper proposes a general-purpose middleware architecture based on multi-agent technology that provides mechanisms to: develop customizable applications based on the separation of concerns principle; manage the execution of applications; support adaptability by means of event-based relationships among applications; ensure availability through the use of replicated agents. The performance of the proposed middleware is assessed in terms of reaction time to adapt to irregular situations for different availability levels (number of replicated agents) and number of application services.",

These guidelines have been drawn up via a systematic method created from the best practices of Agile Software Development Methodologies. This method creates smart, autonomous, collaborative IoA applications based on novel Linked Open Agents (LOAs) that are driven by Linked-Agent Contracts (LACs) and Workflows for Agent Control (WACs). From a practical perspective, our method separates the modeling of components using two levels, microscopic (at agent level) and macroscopic (at agent society level) facilitated the planning, configuring and implementation of each agent in the IoA ecosystem. Moreover, the method facilitates the agent creation automation process, reducing the time required for its development and simplifying the design complexity. These achievements were demonstrated through the modeling of an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) scenario on an office composed by a set of collaborative agents in order to provide smart comfort.",

These systems involve huge financial, people, and time investments within an environment that is characterised by continuously changing technologies and processes. Systems architecture provides the strategies and modelling approaches to ensure that adequate resources are spent in developing the possible To Be states for a target system. Architecture selection and evaluation involves evaluating different architectural alternatives with respect to multiple criteria, hence an Architecture Evaluation Framework which evaluates and down selects the appropriate architectures solutions is crucial to assess how these systems will deliver value over their lifetime, and where to channel the financial and human investments to maximize benefit delivered to the business’ bottom line. In this paper, an evaluation and selection architecture framework is proposed, which targets to maximise the alignment of Engineering Design Systems with business goals based on a quality centric architecture evaluation approach. The framework utilised software Quality Attributes as well as SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) and PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technological) analyses to capture different viewpoints related to technical, political and business context. The framework proposed employing AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) to quantitatively elicit relationships between Quality Attributes trade-offs and architectural characteristics. The framework was applied to a real case study considering five Engineering Design Systems alternative architectures, where workshops with subject matter experts and stakeholders were held to reach an informative decision, that maximise architectural quality, whilst maintaining business alignment.",

Although many initiatives have contributed to the quality improvement of microservices-based systems, there is still a lack of a systematic understanding of the Quality Attributes (QAs) associated with MSA. Objective: This study aims to investigate the evidence-based state-of-the-art of QAs of microservices-based systems. Method: We carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and synthesize the relevant studies that report evidence related to QAs of MSA. Results: Based on the data extracted from the 72 selected primary studies, we portray an overview of the six identified QAs most concerned in MSA, scalability, performance, availability, monitorability, security, and testability. We identify 19 tactics that architecturally address the critical QAs in MSA, including two tactics for scalability, four for performance, four for availability, four for monitorability, three for security, and two for testability. Conclusion: This SLR concludes that for MSA-based systems: 1) Although scalability is the commonly acknowledged benefit of MSA, it is still an indispensable concern among the identified QAs, especially when trading-off with other QAs, e.g., performance. Apart from the six identified QAs in this study, other QAs for MSA like maintainability need more attention for effective improvement and evaluation in the future. 3) Practitioners need to carefully make the decision of migrating to MSA based on the return on investment, since this architectural style additionally cause some pains in practice.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm relying on the interaction of smart objects (things) with each other and with physical and/or virtual resources through the Internet. Despite the recent advances that have made IoT a reality, there are several challenges to be addressed towards exploiting its full potential and promoting tangible benefits to society, environment, economy, and individual citizens. Recently, Cloud Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to tackle some of the existing challenges in IoT while leveraging its adoption and bringing new opportunities. With the combination of IoT and Cloud Computing, the cloud becomes an intermediate layer between smart objects and applications that make use of data and resources provided by these objects. On the one hand, IoT can benefit from the almost unlimited resources of Cloud Computing to implement management and composition of services related to smart objects and their provided data. On the other hand, the cloud can benefit from IoT by broadening its operation scope to deal with real-world objects. In spite of this synergy, the literature still lacks of a broad, comprehensive overview on what has been investigated on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing and what are the open issues to be addressed in future research and development. The goal of this work is to fill this gap by systematically collecting and analyzing studies available in the literature aiming to: (i) obtain a comprehensive understanding on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing paradigms; (ii) provide an overview of the current state of research on this topic; and (iii) identify important gaps in the existing approaches as well as promising research directions. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was performed covering papers recently published in journals, conferences, and workshops, available at five relevant electronic databases. As a result, 35 studies were selected presenting strategies and solutions on how to integrate IoT and Cloud Computing as well as scenarios, research challenges, and opportunities in this context. Besides confirming the increasing interest on the integration of IoT and Cloud Computing, this paper reports the main outcomes of the performed systematic mapping by both presenting an overview of the state of the art on the investigated topic and shedding light on important challenges and potential directions to future research.",

In these emerging fields, there is a need for computerized systems to have a higher understanding of the situations in which to provide services or functionalities, to adapt accordingly. The literature shows that researchers modify existing engineering methods in order to better fit the needs of context-aware computing. These efforts are typically disconnected from each other and generally focus on solving specific development issues. We encourage the creation of a more holistic and unified engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these systems. For this purpose, we study the state-of-the-art in the development of context-aware systems, focusing on: (A) Methodologies for developing context-aware systems, analyzing the reasons behind their lack of adoption and features that the community wish they can use; (B) Context-aware system engineering challenges and techniques applied during the most common development stages; (C) Context-aware systems conceptualization.",

abstract = "Context
Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics (BDCA) systems leverage big data technologies for analyzing security events data to protect organizational networks, computers, and data from cyber attacks.
Objective
We aimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and architectural tactics for BDCA systems.
Method
We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for reviewing 74 papers.
Result
Our findings are twofold: (i) identification of 12 most frequently reported quality attributes for BDCA systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural tactics for addressing the identified quality attributes. The identified tactics include six performance tactics, four accuracy tactics, two scalability tactics, three reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each.
Conclusion
Our study reveals that in the context of BDCA (a) performance, accuracy and scalability are the most important quality concerns (b) data analytics is the most critical architectural component (c) despite the significance of interoperability, modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and privacy assurance, these quality attributes lack explicit architectural support (d) empirical investigation is required to evaluate the impact of the codified tactics and explore the quality trade-offs and dependencies among the tactics and (e) the reported tactics need to be modelled using a standardized modelling language such as UML.",

abstract = "Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems need to be as transparent as possible, that is, their users should perceive only the effects of the features presented to them and, in some cases, some kind of interface. They should not be conscious of how these features are implemented, from a hardware or from a software point of view. In order to obtain such a high degree of transparency, it is necessary for the system to be able to provide its services regardless of location, adapting to the environment and the context in general and to the available hardware more specifically. This is known as ubiquity, and to achieve it requires considering many aspects, from security and privacy to system interoperability. This paper is mainly focused on the development of two elements related to ubiquity: physical migration of components between different platforms together with their associated runtime state, and the adaptation of those components to the destination platform and physical environment. These solutions are being addressed within our efforts for the development of a general-purpose middleware for Ambient Intelligence in the framework of the HI3 project.",

The proposed system unifies heterogeneous wireless sensor networks under a Semantic Web Service middleware. Two complementary and mutually exclusive rule-based approaches for enforcing energy-saving policies are proposed: a reactive agent based on production rules and a deliberative agent based on defeasible logic. The system was deployed at a Greek University, showing promising experimental results (at least 4% daily savings). Although the percentage of energy savings may seem low, the greatest merit of the method is ensuring that no energy is wasted by constantly enforcing the policies.",

abstract = "Measurement is essential to any programme of quality improvement. The manufacturer of a system must be able to measure its dependability. This comprises attributes such as reliability, safety and security, which are external attributes of the system and are measured indirectly by analysis of direct measurements extracted from raw data. An essential part of the collection of raw data is the measurement of failures during system trial and operation. Some will be due to the physical failure of hardware components, others to design faults in hardware, software, or the user interface. Where a design fault is diagnosed, a corrective change is usually made to remove it, and improve dependability. Measurement of dependability requires that the basic entities failure, fault, and change, are measured in a rigorous, consistent, yet practical way. The paper applies principles of scientific measurement to these entities, and defines a set of attributes measured on orthogonal scales, so that measurements of different attributes may be made independently. The proposed scheme is completely general, but can be adapted to any real measurement programme.",
