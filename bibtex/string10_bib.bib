abstract = "One of the most critical issues in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is the design of systems that can evolve to meet the requirements of individuals as their needs and health conditions change. Although much work has been done on home and building automation systems for AAL, often referred to as assistive domotics, there is in fact still a substantial lack of solutions capable to support system designers in the early stage of development of such assistive systems. To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

abstract = "The ongoing revolution of Internet of Things (IoT), together with the growing diffusion of robots in many activities of every day life, makes IoT-aided robotics applications a tangible reality of our upcoming future. Accordingly, new advanced services, based on the interplay between robots and “things”, are being conceived in assisting humans. Nevertheless, the path to a mature development of IoT-aided robotics applications requires several pivotal issues to be solved, design methodologies to be consolidated, and strong architectural choices to be discussed. This paper discusses technological implications, open issues, and target applications in the IoT-aided robotics domain. In particular, the present contribution is four-folded. First, it provides a solid state of the art on the main topics related to IoT-aided robotics services: communication networks, robotics applications in distributed and pervasive environments, semantic-oriented approaches to consensus, and network security. Second, it highlights the most important research challenges to be faced. Third, it describes the technological tools available nowadays. Fourth, it summarizes lessons learned to foster a joint scientific investigation among research teams with complementary skills.",
