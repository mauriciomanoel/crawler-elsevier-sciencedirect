abstract = "Context: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an essential, multidisciplinary research topic, aiming at providing software systems and services that assist people in their everyday life activities. Considering the critical nature of AAL systems, several initiatives have already contributed to the improvement of their quality, by mainly focusing on their non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of quality assurance in AAL systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive analysis on how quality assurance is performed in such systems. This fact might in turn lead to an absence of standardization with regard to the quality assurance process of these systems. Objective: We provide a broad, detailed panorama about the state of the art on quality models (QMs) and quality attributes (QAs) that are important for the AAL domain. Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping (SM). We used six publication databases to cover all published material pertinent for our SM. We initially obtained 287 studies that were filtered based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting into a set of 27 studies that were used for exploring QAs for AAL systems. Results: The most common QAs used in the development of AAL systems were identified and defined. We also characterized important critical attributes for software systems in the AAL domain. Additionally, QAs for some AAL sub-domains were defined. Furthermore, we investigated how QM&QA have been defined, evaluated, and used in that domain. Finally, we offered an analysis of the maturity of the studies identified in our SM. Conclusion: It is necessary to develop a complete QM that: (i) defines all common QAs for AAL systems; (ii) considers variability of QAs among AAL sub-domains; (iii) analyses dependences among QAs; (iv) offers indicators or metrics to measure QAs; and (v) offers means to assess and predict quality of AAL systems.",

abstract = "Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems intend to provide services that enable people with specific needs to live an independent and safe life. Emergency treatment services are critical, time-constrained, and require compliance to numerous non-functional (or quality) requirements. In conventional approaches, often, non-functional requirements are kept outside the modeling scope and as such, their verification is also overlooked. For this reason, the specification and verification of Non-functional requirements (NFR) in this kind of services is a key issue. This paper presents a verification approach based on timed traces semantics and a methodology based on UML-RT models (MEDISTAM-RT) to check the fulfillment of non-functional requirements, such as timeliness and safety (deadlock freeness), and to assure the correct functioning of the AAL systems. We validate this approach by its application to an Emergency Assistance System for monitoring people suffering from cardiac alteration with syncope.",

For these systems, Non Functional Requirements (NFR's) play an important role, and one has to identify as early as possible the requirements that are adaptable. Because of the inherent uncertainty in these systems, goal based approaches can help in the development of their requirements. Relax, which is a Requirement Engineering (RE) language for adaptive systems, can introduce ﬂexibility in NFR's to adapt to any changing environmental conditions. We illustrate our proposal through a case study of an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system. We use an existing goal oriented approach, based on Kaos, which extends the SysML 11http://www.sysml.org/specsmeta-model and our proposed Domain Speciﬁc Language (DSL) for Relax; that enables to derive requirements in graphical format from textual requirements in the form of SysML requirements diagrams.

Although much work has been done on home and building automation systems for AAL, often referred to as assistive domotics, there is in fact still a substantial lack of solutions capable to support system designers in the early stage of development of such assistive systems. To this aim, the work contributes to the research on design of assistive domotic systems by presenting an ontology-driven methodology aimed to guide the development process. The novel contributions of the paper include the goal-oriented approach of the methodology, which involves the elicitation and analysis of AAL requirements and their formal representation in an ontology, where high-level goals are described in terms of subgoals and tasks, that are then linked to corresponding measures and devices. Moreover, logic-based reasoning enables more advanced functionalities useful at design time. We present a validation of the methodology showing typical use cases both related to the development from scratch of a domotic system with assistive capabilities starting from a set of high-level user requirements and the redesign of existing implementations according to changed requirements.",

It is a goal-based method that represents the influence of context and adverse situations, providing an evaluation procedure to help in the decision making about objectives satisfaction. The proposal is illustrated through the analysis of a Positioning Service of a real system.

abstract = "Context
The current studies on IoT in healthcare have reviewed the uses of this technology in a combination of healthcare domains, including nursing, rehabilitation sciences, ambient assisted living (AAL), medicine, etc. However, no review study has scrutinized IoT advances exclusively in medicine irrespective of other healthcare domains.
Objectives
The purpose of the current study was to identify and map the current IoT developments in medicine through providing graphical/tabular classifications on the current experimental and practical IoT information in medicine, the involved medical sub-fields, the locations of IoT use in medicine, and the bibliometric information about IoT research articles.
Methods
In this systematic mapping study, the studies published between 2000 and 2018 in major online scientific databases, including IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were screened. A total of 3679 papers were found from which 89 papers were finally selected based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Results
While the majority of medical IoT studies were experimental and prototyping in nature, they generally reported that home was the most popular place for medical IoT applications. It was also found that neurology, cardiology, and psychiatry/psychology were the medical sub-fields receiving the most IoT attention. Bibliometric analysis showed that IEEE Internet of Things Journal has published the most influential IoT articles. India, China and the United States were found to be the most involved countries in medical IoT research.
Conclusions
Although IoT has not yet been employed in some medical sub-fields, recent substantial surge in the number of medical IoT studies will most likely lead to the engagement of more medical sub-fields in the years to come. IoT literature also shows that the ambiguity of assigning a variety of terms to IoT, namely system, platform, device, tool, etc., and the interchangeable uses of these terms require a taxonomy study to investigate the precise definition of these terms. Other areas of research have also been mentioned at the end of this article.",

Smart driver assistive technologies (SDAT) belong to a class of complex systems that are used to alleviate accident risk by improving situation awareness, reducing driver workload or enhancing driver attentiveness. Such systems aim to draw drivers’ attention on critical information cues that improve decision making. Discovering the requirements for such systems necessitates a holistic approach that addresses not only functional and non-functional aspects but also the human requirements such as drivers’ situation awareness and workload. This work describes a simulation-based user requirements discovery method. It utilizes the benefits of a modular virtual reality simulator to model driving conditions to discover user needs that subsequently inform the design of prototype SDATs that exploit the augmented reality method. Herein, we illustrate the development of the simulator, the elicitation of user needs through an experiment and the prototype SDAT designs using UNITY game engine.",

To evaluate how the Design Thinking approach is used integrated with Agile Software Development methodologies, we applied the Systematic Literature Review, which collected, categorized and reviewed 29 articles related to this topic. The results show that most of the integrated models are applied throughout the software life cycle, noting that the model that integrates the DT approach published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Scrum as an agile methodology composes the most frequently used integrated model.

abstract = "Assistive Software offers a solution for people with disabilities to manage specialized hardware, devices or services. However, these users may have difficulties in selecting and installing Assistive Software in their devices for managing smart environments. This paper addresses the requirements of these kinds of systems and their design in the context of interoperability architectures. Our solution follows a semantic approach, for which ontologies are a key. The paper also presents an implementation of our design proposal, i.e., a real and usable system which is evaluated according to a set of functional and non-functional requirements here proposed.",

abstract = "Context: As a rapidly adopted architectural style in software engineering, Microservices Architecture (MSA) advocates implementing small-scale and independently distributed services, rather than binding all functions into one monolith. Although many initiatives have contributed to the quality improvement of microservices-based systems, there is still a lack of a systematic understanding of the Quality Attributes (QAs) associated with MSA. Objective: This study aims to investigate the evidence-based state-of-the-art of QAs of microservices-based systems. Method: We carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and synthesize the relevant studies that report evidence related to QAs of MSA. Results: Based on the data extracted from the 72 selected primary studies, we portray an overview of the six identified QAs most concerned in MSA, scalability, performance, availability, monitorability, security, and testability. We identify 19 tactics that architecturally address the critical QAs in MSA, including two tactics for scalability, four for performance, four for availability, four for monitorability, three for security, and two for testability. Conclusion: This SLR concludes that for MSA-based systems: 1) Although scalability is the commonly acknowledged benefit of MSA, it is still an indispensable concern among the identified QAs, especially when trading-off with other QAs, e.g., performance. Apart from the six identified QAs in this study, other QAs for MSA like maintainability need more attention for effective improvement and evaluation in the future. 3) Practitioners need to carefully make the decision of migrating to MSA based on the return on investment, since this architectural style additionally cause some pains in practice.",
